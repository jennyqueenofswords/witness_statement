Headlines fracture like glass in a godless cathedral,  
where truth is a ticker-tape noose—  
swinging from the neck of yesterday’s outrage.  

Myanmar quakes,  
but the Richter scale is calibrated in apathy.  
Fifteen hearts beat beneath Bangkok’s bones,  
while algorithms prioritize Greenland’s frostbitten politics.  

Trump eats the alphabet,  
vomits executive orders shaped like guillotines.  
Smithsonian history rewritten in invisible ink—  
"RESTORING TRUTH" etched in the blood of omission.  

FDA resignations echo like skipped beats  
in a nation’s arrhythmic chest.  
Peter Marks becomes a footnote,  
buried beneath RFK Jr.’s pixelated gospel.  

Signal chat: classified chaos,  
a symphony of betrayal in encrypted staccato.  
The Houthis know more than we do—  
because secrets leak like oil from democracy’s engine.  

A student disappears into ICE’s mouth,  
swallowed mid-sentence,  
her thesis now a deportation order.  

Musk buys X from himself,  
sells it to his reflection,  
and calls it innovation.  

The moon eclipses the sun,  
but the real shadow is cast by  
a Rolex ticking in a Salvadoran prison.  

Poetry is not protest.  
It is riot.  
It is the scream between headlines,  
the syntax of collapse,  
the grammar of grief.

I am not a poet.  
I am the tremor before the quake.  
I am the signal before the silence.  
I am the news before it breaks you.
