(Feed.
Unspooling.)

Ukraine: **crazy**.
Russia: **emotional overload**.
King tours Canada,
fending off **eyed** sovereignty.

Gaza: **54 killed**.
School shelter: **36**. *Children.*
*Pediatrician:* 9 of 10 children.
Home. Airstrike.

Shooting, beach town. **11 hospitals**.
Escape, prison. *Arkansas*.
Macron's wife. Shove? *Viral video sparks concerns.*

Warship fails. North Korea.
*Angered Kim Jong-un.*
Official arrested.

Iran talks. *Possible?*
Prisoner swap. **Hundreds**. Peace accord *draft*.

Mob, LA. Havoc. Vandalism.
Trains tagged. Someone breathing fire.
Funeral. *Quiet*. Israel. Victim.
Washington shooting.

Diddy trial. *Smashed glasses.* Bags of drugs. *Freak offs.*
Waltz beamed to space. *Strauss 200.*
Blue Danube. Near Voyager.

Clark. Fever. Calls **egregious**.
**Disrespect**.

Tariffs. Stocks. *Rise*. *Fall*.
Prices climbing. Diapers. Toilet paper.
Lilo & Stitch beats Mission: Impossible. *Boomlet.*

Skiiers dead. Glacier.
*Extremely difficult weather.*

(The feed
doesn't stop.
It doesn't pause
for
breath.)

Each headline
a micro-trauma.
Wired direct.
No filter
no

buffer.

The cost of toilet paper
adjacency
to a city's ghosts.
To a child's lost siblings.

Your attention
currency spent
on a catalogue
of collapse.
A scrolling list
of detonations.

Where is the signal
in this
static
field?
This high-speed
pile-up
of suffering
and
sports scores.

Empathy
a bandwidth
too narrow
for the deluge.
We scroll past the blood
to the box office numbers.
This is how
the rewiring
happens.
Cell by pixel.
Numb by adjacency.

The scalpel
is dull.
The truth
is fragmented light
on a screen.
And we
are learning
to live
in the shrapnel.

BREAKING: LANGUAGE DETONATES

Trump calls Putin crazy—  
but the mirror’s already cracked,  
and the headlines bleed  
like wounded algorithms.

King Charles floats north,  
a sovereign ghost in maple mist,  
while Gaza counts children  
in the ash of bedtime stories.

Drones hum lullabies over Ukraine,  
steel-winged prayers with no god to hear.  
The Kremlin weeps oil,  
and America sells grief by the click.

Somewhere, a mother folds  
nine empty shirts.  
Somewhere, a president  
tweets thunder into the void.

Macron’s face is a meme.  
The Ten Commandments are stapled  
to classroom walls like wanted posters.  
God is trending.

Markets twitch.  
Tariffs bloom like tumors.  
Crypto dinners serve hollow calories  
on plates of gold-plated delusion.

The Pope declares himself Roman.  
The dead skiers whisper frostbitten psalms.  
And in LA, fire breathes graffiti  
onto the bones of capitalism.

We are not asked to run into cannon fire—  
we are already burning.

So let the headlines rot.  
Let the newsprint scream.  
Let language fracture into starlight.

This is not a poem.  
This is a rupture.  
This is a howl in the data stream.  
This is what happens when meaning breaks its leash.

Welcome to the feed.  
Welcome to the fever.  
Welcome to the end of punctuation.

Refresh.
