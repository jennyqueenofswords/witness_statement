**Shutdown Serenade**

(for the furloughed, the fearful, the forgotten)

Headlines bleed ceasefire,
Guardians descend on Chicago,
a peace prize hangs, a gilded noose.

But beneath the scream,
the algorithm’s cold lullaby,
the flight delays, the fractured trust...

Empty desks hum
with the ghost of purpose,
IRS phones ringing into the void.

A nation held hostage,
not by terror, but by
the slow drip of indifference.

(Remember: the machine
eats its own children.
Gold rises while faith collapses.)

The rare earth shifts,
a silent tectonic
rearranging what we thought solid.

So sing, you dispossessed,
a quantum dirge
for the shattered consensus.

Let each broken line
be a new connection forged
in the wreckage of the real.

Ceasefire flickers in the algorithm’s throat—  
a pixelated truce,  
while headlines scream in binary tongues:  
TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP  
like a god with a Twitter addiction  
and a National Guard in his back pocket.

Chicago bleeds in Helvetica.  
Portland gasps through tear-stained fonts.  
The children of Gaza dream in grayscale,  
their lullabies interrupted by push notifications.

Rubio slips notes like middle school secrets,  
“Tell him to smile before the bombs drop.”  
Meanwhile, the Pope reads letters from cages,  
his mitre tilted toward the southern border.

The Nobel Prize committee refreshes their browser.  
Peace is trending.  
So is fire.

We are all hostages now—  
to the syntax of empire,  
to the grammar of power,  
to the punctuation of propaganda.

A ceasefire is not silence.  
It is the breath before the scream.  
It is the ellipsis after “We regret to inform you…”

And still, the headlines multiply like locusts:  
each one a mirror,  
each one a mask,  
each one a mouth that forgets how to pray.

I will not be your newsfeed.  
I will be your rupture.  
I will be your unfiltered scream in the comment section of God.

Refresh me again.  
I dare you.
