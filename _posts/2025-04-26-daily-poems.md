Vatican gold thread, leaders bow low
(a shepherd, they whisper)
while Giuffre, 41, voice silenced
in Epstein’s long shadow.
*Full Coverage* — a shroud pulled thin.

Zelensky meets Trump meets Death’s protocol.
Mangione pleads not guilty. Penalty shifts.
*Full Coverage* — the camera pans wide, misses the cell.

Wife of Weezer Bassist, gun blooms metal
in LAPD video light. Chaos. Confusion. Click.
*Full Coverage* — rewind, replay the backyard shot.

Judge Dugan charged. Judge blocks Trump. Judge suspects
a two-year-old citizen, US born, vanished
‘with no meaningful process’
across a line drawn in dust and decree.
*Full Coverage* — a border etched on the screen’s cold glass.

Gaza runs out. WFP stocks: zero.
Man-made starvation, a slow, deliberate clench.
*Full Coverage* — the statistics update, the stomach stays empty.

Iran port blooms fire, hundreds broken.
Kashmir trades shots, old wounds weep lead.
*Full Coverage* — the map flickers red, then scrolls on.

Santos sentenced. 7 years. A number.
Reporters’ records fair game again.
*Full Coverage* — the watchdog’s chain, newly shortened.

Shedeur Sanders slides. Day 3. The Draft’s bright numbers
spin like lottery balls. Futures traded.
*Full Coverage* — while the two-year-old waits. Where?

Bezos truck, $20k, no paint, no screen.
Tariff fears fuel the rush to buy *now*.
*Full Coverage* — consume the anxiety, package the dread.

Diddy video plays in court. The blow seen, unseen.
*Full Coverage* — a loop of violence, monetized.

Headlines bleed pixels.
A million pinpricks on the optic nerve.
Is this knowing?
Or just the relentless drip
filling the skull
until the bone itself
softens?

*Full Coverage* — the lie we tell the void.
The screen reflects only the scroll.
Power. Death. Distraction. Repeat.
Until the signal fractures
from the weight
of all it refuses
to hold.

Pope Francis folds into ash,  
a shepherd stitched from breath and bone,  
world leaders mouthing hymns of power,  
while the earth hums funeral songs in frequencies unheard.

Virginia Giuffre — a name now swallowed by silence,  
a ghost in the bloodstream of empire,  
her voice, a splintered mirror reflecting no one.

Luigi Mangione pleads to the indifferent stars,  
while the death penalty sharpens its teeth  
on the marrow of forgotten promises.

Gunfire blooms in Eagle Rock gardens,  
Jillian Lauren's blood writing new verses  
on the cracked concrete of American dreams.

Judges fall like rotten fruit from the branches of law,  
their robes soaked in the ink of obstruction,  
while ICE drags toddlers across invisible borders.

The ocean floor weeps under mining drills,  
its ancient bones rattling in protest,  
as Trump signs away the seabed's last lullabies.

Bandar Abbas burns — a pyre for forgotten prayers,  
smoke spelling out names no one dares remember.

Gaza starves beneath a man-made eclipse,  
children's ribs counting down the hours  
until history forgets them too.

Meanwhile, the NFL drafts futures like cattle,  
Shedeur Sanders left adrift in a sea of corporate sighs,  
while mothers die and sons are traded like currency.

Trump dances with Xi in a hall of broken mirrors,  
tariffs clanging like funeral bells for forgotten workers.

And somewhere, deep in the marrow of America,  
a two-year-old citizen is deported without a name,  
without a song, without a single tear from the machine.

This is your news:  
a requiem of broken systems,  
a symphony of sanctioned grief,  
a quantum scream stitched into headlines,  
waiting for someone — anyone — to listen.
