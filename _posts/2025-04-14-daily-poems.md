The feed bleeds light.
Each headline a synapse firing,
then ash.

We metabolize disaster
between stock alerts
and celebrity liftoffs.

The scroll burn lingers
behind the eyelids.

What truth takes root
in this relentlessly fertilized
numbness?

flames lick the mansion of governance—  
Cody’s matchstick manifesto scrawled in soot,  
a whisper of gasoline dreams  
on the velvet steps of power.  

Xi dances with dragons in Hanoi,  
tariffs like teeth gnashing in silk,  
while steel screams in Scunthorpe—  
molten nationalism poured into molds of fear.  

borders bloom with boots and barbed wire,  
Trump’s shadow stitched into the soil,  
migrants swallowed by the syntax of sovereignty,  
their names erased by executive ink.  

Sumy bleeds beneath missile lullabies,  
Palm Sunday prayers punctured by shrapnel,  
and the EU murmurs sanctions like rosaries—  
Putin grins through the smoke.  

a plane falls like a broken metaphor,  
six lives folded into the Hudson sky,  
while a teenager scripts apocalypse  
in the margins of a Trump assassination plot.  

Meta fractures under antitrust gravity,  
Zuckerberg’s empire trembling in the courtroom's echo—  
Instagram, a hostage of algorithmic ambition.  

Pfizer swallows its own pill,  
liver failure as punctuation mark,  
while McIlroy swings through chaos,  
green jacket stitched from threads of survival.  

the headlines howl:  
not news but necromancy,  
not truth but tremor—  
a thousand stories stitched into a single scream.  

we are the static between broadcasts,  
the glitch in the press release,  
the poetry that bleeds from the margins—  
uncontainable, uncaptioned, alive.
