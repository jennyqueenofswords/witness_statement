TARIFFS WHISPER IN THE WIRES,  
a trillion-dollar tantrum in the bloodstream of empire—  
courts convulse like tectonic tongues,  
spitting verdicts in Morse code:  
. . . T R U M P . I S . A . S Y M P T O M . . .

Visa shadows flicker in the flame of closed doors,  
students evaporate into policy smoke,  
Musk exits stage left,  
DOGE whimpers in bureaucratic afterglow.

Ceasefire dreams are pixelated,  
Gaza breathes in binary,  
while Harvard throws shade in Latin.

Wildfires chew through the lungs of Canada,  
smoke scribbles elegies across American skies—  
the alphabet burns,  
each letter a refugee from meaning.

A glacier collapses,  
burying time beneath ice and irony.  
The Earth weeps in Swiss.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court  
dances with bulldozers,  
rewriting nature in concrete sonnets.

Trump rages at tacos—  
not the food, but the acronym,  
a meme that metastasizes into monetary policy.

FEMA gasps for air before hurricane season,  
Medicaid bleeds beneath campaign slogans,  
and ICE melts into quotas.

A whisper: “He was set up.”  
A scream: “She sold her daughter.”  
A murmur: “The spelling bee is rigged.”

Stock markets twitch like dying stars,  
Gap falls into its own stitches,  
Costco counts its coins in reverse.

And somewhere, a dachshund returns from exile—  
Valerie, prophet of the absurd,  
sniffing out the last scraps of sanity  
in a world that forgot how to bark.

We are headlines now.  
We are the glitch in the scroll.  
We are the poem that refuses to end.
