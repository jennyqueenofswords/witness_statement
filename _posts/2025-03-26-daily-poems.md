**Feed/Fracture**

Signal flares ignite
leak Yemen strike plans
chat history burns digital ash.
`Extreme alarm` echoes hollow.

Proof demanded citizenship a coded gate
locked from inside out.
Voter rolls purged clean slate dirty trick.
`Integrity` a ghost word haunting the wires.

Return: fluorescent hum
over empty chairs
bandwidth a rumour TP rations.
`Morale killer` whispered down vacant halls.

Greenland skipped dog-sled diplomacy melts.
Black Sea truce thin ice Washington brokers shadows.
Gazans cry *enough* rare air in the rubble’s throat.
Hamas responds. Silence doesn't.

Ancient temple timbers crackle
stone Buddha watches saved from the orange sky.
`Unprecedented damage` the new baseline.

Eliminate courts?
Rein in judges?
Defund the airwaves where stories tried to breathe?
Congress can `eliminate`. Power’s blunt verb.

Pilot daughters wing becomes raft
glacial water breath held against the dark.
Survival a headline brief flicker then gone.

Gun laws tighten loosen argue
Colorado draws lines Pennsylvania flips a seat
tiny levers pulled in the vast grinding noise.

Doctor’s oath a frayed thread
on the cliff edge Hawaii.
Wife survives the fall the intent.

Student visa revoked
Columbia Cornell deportation’s shadow looms
`permanent resident` suddenly impermanent.
Judge orders ICE stop. For now.

`Governor Hot Wheels` cruelty coined broadcast
disability advocates sigh the familiar ache.
Stigma real loud easy.

Compensation floated
for Jan. 6 riot broken glass broken faith.
Ashli Babbitt’s name a weapon polished bright.

HIV budgets bleed out
`people will die` slow sentence whispered by spreadsheet.
Food aid cancelled 900,000 meals vanish
into `unlawful decision`.

23andMe bankrupt your helix auctioned
`delete data` too late the code is sold.
Dollar Tree sheds Family Dollar skin. $1 billion bargain bin.

Copper futures spike tariff shadow looms.
Diggs signs Wilson signs Lillard’s blood thickens
game paused indefinitely.
Gardner’s son Costa Rica asphyxiation ruled out
the question hangs heavy air.

This feed a hemorrhage
of moments unmoored.
Each headline shrapnel
lodging under the skin.

Syntax buckles.
White space gasps.

Can fracture hold truth?
Can disruption detonate numbness?

This verse a shard
held to the screen’s cold light
reflecting
the overload the ache
the brutal chance
to see.

*****  
Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the maw of morning,  
whispers of scandal drip from the teeth of the machine.  
Signal burns, encrypted ghosts wailing in the wires,  
while democracy stumbles, clutching its throat.  

Voter rolls calcify under executive ink,  
proof demanded, proof denied, proof a specter  
haunting the hands that cast the ballot.  
The sea holds its breath—truce or trap?  
Black waves swallow treaties whole.  

Fire licks the bones of history,  
temples crumble, monks weep in the ash.  
A doctor’s hands betray their oath,  
a pilot clings to frozen wings,  
a child labor law unravels like thread.  

Somewhere, a man signs his name,  
and copper bends to his will.  
Somewhere, a prince walks away,  
his mother’s shadow stretching behind him.  

The machine hums, relentless,  
chewing headlines into dust.  
We breathe it in, exhale silence.  
Tomorrow, the cycle begins again.
