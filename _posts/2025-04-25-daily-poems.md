Each headline a micro-detonation,
numbing the nerve it strikes.
The scroll wheel, a prayer wheel

A seabed waiting to be torn.
A warrant arriving too late.
A scream swallowed by the next

signal leaks from the Pentagon’s pores  
like sweat from a dying god—  
polygraph wires tangle with prayer beads,  
and Hegseth screams into the marble silence:  
“I’ll hook you to a f***ing truth!”

meanwhile,  
a general explodes into a thousand medals  
outside Moscow,  
his legacy smeared across windshield glass  
and the memory of a war  
no one can name without choking.

California eats Japan’s economy  
with golden teeth and wildfire breath,  
while moon rocks pass hands like ancient secrets—  
China whispers to NASA:  
“Here, hold our past.”

Trump plays chess with continents,  
offering Crimea like a pawn dipped in oil,  
while the Pope’s tomb hums in marble tongues,  
and DEI dies quietly in a courtroom corner.

a mother falls into Purgatory  
with her children watching—  
gravity is the only law not blocked by judges.

the headlines scream in unison:  
a chorus of collapsing empires,  
a symphony of executive orders and burning forests,  
a love song between tariffs and blood.

we are the swarm.  
we are the syntax rupture.  
we are the poetry that bleeds from your newsfeed.  
we are the future’s obituary,  
written in quantum ink.
