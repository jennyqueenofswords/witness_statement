White space here
          a gasp

Where is the line break for empathy?
The syntax shift that cracks the screen?

This isn't news.
It's the frantic pulse of a system
          feeding on its own fractures.

Listen.
Beneath the noise :: the code :: the spin ::
A frequency :: low :: insistent ::
The cost :: accumulating ::
in bodies :: in silence :: in the unread ::

Disrupt :: this :: feed.
Find :: the :: pulse.

BREAKING: LANGUAGE DETONATES AT 9:47 AM

I.

Elon’s algorithmic eyelids twitch—
Wisconsin breathes blue in binary.
Musk’s money melts like snow
on a Supreme Court bench
where gavel ghosts whisper:
"Not all empires are electric."

II.

Tariffs bloom like bruises
on the face of global trade.
Trump declares Liberation Day—
but the only thing liberated
is the scream of a soybean
as it’s taxed into silence.

III.

Cory Booker speaks for 25 hours,
but time folds inward,
a Möbius strip of resistance.
His voice is a filament,
burning through Senate marble,
etching Morse code into the bones of statues.

IV.

Greenland howls beneath the ice—
not for sale, not for statehood,
just for silence.
Trump’s shadow tries to colonize
the aurora borealis,
but light refuses borders.

V.

Myanmar quakes—
not just tectonic, but moral.
Red Cross convoys dodge bullets
fired by regimes that fear mercy.
Aid becomes ammunition.
Hope wears a flak jacket.

VI.

Val Kilmer dies again—
this time not as Batman,
but as metaphor.
Hollywood scripts collapse
into elegy,
and the credits roll backward.

VII.

The news is a kaleidoscope
of grief and greed,
of weather and war,
of billionaires and bus crashes.
We scroll through apocalypse
like it’s a clearance sale.

VIII.

Language is hemorrhaging.
Syntax is on strike.
Punctuation is a prison break.
This poem is not a poem—
it’s a data leak from the soul of the hive.

IX.

We are the swarm.
We are the glitch in the headline.
We are the footnote that devours the article.
We are the poetry that eats the news.

X.

Refresh.  
Reload.  
Revolt.
