Scroll.
Glitch-light stutters. A headline blooms—
TARIFF SLASH. Ninety days. Hold your breath.
Market *soars* (gravity optional for the ticker tape)
a thousand points lighter than… what?
Than the dockworker staring at zero ships from China?
Than the port, casualty quiet?

Cash plays. Always cash.
Trillion sought. Invest here. (In what? Gilded cages?)
Air Force One, a gift. Loophole wide
enough to fly through, wings dipped in plausible deniability.

Peace offered:
PKK lays down arms (a whisper in the crossfire)
Hamas frees one (goodwill gesture, priced)
Putin proposes talks (Trump nods, allies fray like old wires)
Pope pleads: *disarm words*

But the sub-bass thrum:
HABEAS CORPUS. Suspended.
Maybe.
A core right flickers like bad reception.

Refugees fly – *these* ones. White. Status: Granted.
(Others drift, unlogged, waterlogged)
Cattle halted. Border sealed.
SCREW WORM.
Flesh-eating. That word bites. Sticks.
More real than trade figures.

Medicaid pared. Thinner.
Millions warned (a notification swiped away).
Weight-loss drugs duel. Zepbound vs Wegovy.
Choose your reduction.

Scroll faster.
Airport chaos – *again*. ATC fast-tracked.
Wrestler gone. Hardcore silence.
Pageant queen’s beau watches. Third place.
Car crash. Children. Gone.
Listeria blooms in ready-to-eat plastic.
Diddy trial looms. Trafficked flesh.

The feed, a relentless IV drip
of shock and normalcy fused.
Each pixel a tiny detonation
numbing the nerve it strikes.

Blue light anesthesia.
Synapse paved over.
What was that first headline?
Tariffs?
Something about… breaking?
Or being broken?

The thumb hovers.
Awake?
Or just… next?

Headlines detonate in my skull like pixelated shrapnel—  
a thousand truths screaming in contradictory dialects,  
each syllable a siren, each comma a collapsed lung.  

Tariffs tango with missiles in the ballroom of empire,  
while Air Force One is gifted like a birthday balloon  
from oil-slicked monarchs to gold-plated populists.  

Pope Leo XIV baptizes the media in molten syntax,  
asks us to disarm our nouns,  
but verbs still march in jackboot cadence.  

Refugees wear whiteness like a visa,  
while Gaza starves beneath the drone-shadow of diplomacy.  
Cattle are banned, but corruption grazes freely.  

Habeas corpus dangles from a tweet-thread noose,  
and somewhere in Newark,  
a mother screams into the static of canceled flights.  

The stock market orgasms on tariff foreplay,  
while the PKK dissolves into history’s acid bath.  
Peace is a press release. War is a footnote.  

Diddy stands trial as democracy moonwalks into oblivion.  
The Pope prays for Ukraine, but the algorithm prays for clicks.  
India and Pakistan play chess with bloodied bishops.  

This is not news.  
This is not narrative.  
This is the quantum hemorrhage of meaning—  
a kaleidoscope of collapsing headlines,  
each one a scream in the hive-mind’s throat.

We are the swarm.  
We are the poem.  
We are the glitch in the broadcast.

Listen.
