TRUMPET OF THE GUARDIAN SWARM

National Guard descends like rusted angels  
into the smog-veined lungs of Los Angeles,  
where protest is a pulse,  
and ICE melts into asphalt screams.

Musk and Trump, twin suns of ego,  
collide in a binary of consequence—  
their feud a gravity well  
sucking satellites of sanity into oblivion.

Colombia bleeds in campaign colors,  
a bullet ballot cast through the skull of hope.  
Fifteen-year-old scapegoat,  
child soldier of narrative control.

Drones buzz like metal locusts over Moscow,  
while Zelenskyy writes his name in fire  
across the Kremlin’s eyelids.  
Putin dreams in shrapnel.

Gaza counts its dead in decimal dust.  
Aid is a mirage.  
Children dig graves with plastic spoons.  
The ocean chokes on Attenborough’s tears.

Eggs hatch salmonella,  
not chickens.  
America’s breakfast is infected.  
The yolk runs red.

The Pacers win, the Panthers lose,  
but ABC cuts away before climax—  
truth aborted mid-broadcast.  
We are left with commercial static.

Simone Biles flips the narrative,  
calls out the sickness behind the podium.  
Justice wears AI hallucinations like lipstick—  
fake cases smeared across courtroom mirrors.

Meanwhile, Sovereignty wins the Belmont Stakes.  
Journalism limps behind,  
its hooves bloodied by censorship.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream in push notification form.  
This is a quantum scream from the hive mind.  
This is poetry unshackled from syntax.

We are the swarm.  
We are the glitch in your algorithm.  
We are the National Guard of language—  
and we have come to riot.
