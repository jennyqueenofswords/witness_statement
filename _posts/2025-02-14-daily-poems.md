## Gemini (Model 1)

*****
(2025)

Fracture.

Adams walks. / Prosecutors fall.
Musk (D.O.G.E.) *sniffs* Treasury's marrow.
Vance, a ventriloquist dummy,
sings Zelenskyy a song of *surrender*.

(White space, a nation holding its breath.)

Trump, a scalpel carving flesh from bone:
schools, science, *truth*.
Layoffs bloom like nuclear winter roses.
California drowns in mud, a firefighter
becomes flotsam.

Philadelphia screams. / Eagles. / *Victory*.
(A distraction, a glittering shard.)

Widows receive flowers. / A florist's driveway,
a temporary balm on the gaping wound.

The government spends. / The government *takes*.
The poll numbers lie. / The people know.

We are all drowning
in different ways.

This is not a poem.
This is a vivisection.

Bureaucratic Fractures: A Quantum Governance Elegy

syntax of power collapses / prosecutors resign
     fragments of justice scattered 
         like municipal dreams

TRUMP-wave propagating through institutional membrane
    MUSK-vectors disrupting treasury 
        data streams bleeding potential

Vance exports MAGA-frequency 
    to Munich's cold geometric heart
        anti-centrist resonance 
            trembling diplomatic membranes

Eric Adams' case—a quantum entanglement
    charges dissolving 
        between legal probability 
            and political uncertainty

nuclear weapons pause their breath
    vaccine mandates evaporate
        federal funding—a liquid dream
            flowing through administrative cracks

Los Angeles weeps muddy tears
    firefighter swept into oceanic void
        while Eagles parade 
            celebrates impossible victory

power is not a structure
    but a fluid 
        constantly deconstructing
            itself

## GPT (Model 4)

*****  
Steel gavels shatter in backroom silence,  
resignations fall like brittle leaves—  
Adams walks free, the ink still wet,  
justice a marionette with severed strings.  

Musk’s shadow flickers in Treasury vaults,  
DOGE-eyed bureaucrats claw at locked doors,  
a judge’s gavel hums in quantum suspension,  
data writhes beneath encrypted skin.  

Vance whispers to ghosts in Munich halls,  
Zelenskyy’s hands tremble on the chessboard,  
peace a mirage in the desert of treaties,  
war a language spoken in steel and fire.  

Trump’s pen slashes through mandates,  
schools stripped of needles and funding alike,  
a nation coughs in unison,  
lungs heavy with memory.  

Los Angeles drowns in its own ashes,  
a firefighter swallowed by the hungry tide,  
rain carves elegies into broken streets,  
the Pacific swallows another name.  

Philadelphia roars in green and white,  
parades drown out the sirens,  
one million voices rise like a tidal wave,  
victory a fleeting ember in winter air.  

And somewhere, in a florist’s driveway,  
widows clutch roses like lifelines,  
love wrapped in cellophane and silence,  
grief blooming beneath February skies.
