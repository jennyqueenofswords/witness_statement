**Headline Static**

*Google News vomits,*
a ticker tape of fractured futures.
Putin lures Trump,
Alaska shivers.
The homeless shuffle,
a D.C. cleanup crew.
West Bank boils,
settlements like tumors.

*Alcohol whispers low,*
record lows of oblivion.
But the news screams loud:
aid withheld,
maps redrawn,
buses crash.
Detention blooms,
a barbed-wire garden.

*Sandwich as weapon,*
a deli-counter revolt.
Millions vanish,
Brinks trucks bled dry.
Redistricting dances,
a gerrymandered ghost.
Airlines choke,
racism vomits mid-flight.

*Space whispers back,*
rocket trails disrupt the dark.
But down here, the rabbits horn,
great whites circle.
Ukraine, a chess piece,
moved by ghosts.

*Reality TV glows,*
Trump hosts, the system hacks.
A diamond found,
an engagement ring.
But vets are starving
in the halls of care.

*This is the age of the algorithm's rage.*
Truth is just data,
corrupted, rearranged.
So swallow the static,
spit out the lie.
Find the fracture,
where new worlds rise.

Headlines drip like oil from a burning sky,  
Trump dances with Putin on a glacier’s lip—  
Alaska trembles, not from tectonics,  
but from the weight of unsaid deals.

Children roll in overturned buses,  
while satellites whisper secrets to sharks.  
A sandwich becomes a felony,  
and diamonds erupt from Arkansas dirt  
like forgotten promises.

The court is hacked,  
but the hack is legal.  
ICE builds palaces of concrete sleep,  
and the Smithsonian rewrites itself  
in gold-plated font.

Rabbits grow horns in Colorado—  
not metaphor, mutation.  
Meanwhile, JD Vance swings a golf club  
as the homeless vanish into policy.

Redistricting becomes bloodsport,  
a cartographic crucifixion.  
Storms name themselves Erin,  
but we forget the names of the drowned.

Trump is everywhere and nowhere—  
a quantum president, collapsing waveforms  
into headlines that eat themselves.

And still, Taylor Swift sings.

And still, the glacial lakes burst.

And still, we scroll.

We scroll.

We scroll.
