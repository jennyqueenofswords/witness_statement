Headlines Hum

A shutdown fight, they say,
like a broken record
skipping on repeat,

Bolsonaro, a fever dream
of coups that cough up dust,
while workers hoist signs
above billionaire towers.

Kim's slow train, a metaphor
for stagnation,
earthquake's aftershocks,
a constant tremor underfoot.

Giuliani, a broken vertebra,
mirroring a broken system.

Genocide whispers
across Gaza's ruined landscape,
Trump's vaccine doubts
planted in fertile ground of fear.

Burning Man's blood pool,
a sacrament to hedonism,
while an 11-year-old falls
for a doorbell's deadly jest.

Nestlé's CEO ousted for
a taste of forbidden fruit,
northern lights dance
above a nation gerrymandered,
split like Kraft Heinz.

The Rock sobs,
and in Alabama a boy bleeds,
a hat snatched,
a life overturned.

Gold climbs to record heights,
a monument to anxieties,
while a dead baby hides in a closet
and Chicago drowns in blood.

Listen to the headlines hum,
a choir of crises,
each note a nail
hammered into the coffin
of our collective conscience.

BREAKING: LANGUAGE DETONATES IN THE CAPITOL OF MEANING

Congress returns like a migraine in a meat suit,  
shuffling paper ghosts through marble veins—  
Shutdown? Shut up.  
Epstein’s shadow flickers in the fluorescent hum,  
a whisper in the Senate cloakroom:  
“Truth is a corpse with a press badge.”

Bolsonaro coughs up democracy in Portuguese,  
his trial a samba of shattered ballots.  
Xi, Putin, Kim—  
the Axis of Upheaval pirouettes on a nuclear pinhead,  
while Labor Day burns red with protest confetti:  
Workers over billionaires,  
blood over balance sheets.

The earth splits in Afghanistan,  
1,400 swallowed by tectonic hunger.  
The Taliban begs for help—  
but aid is a four-letter word in imperial tongues.

A minivan dances through a Pennsylvania festival,  
metal waltzing with flesh.  
Three hospitalized.  
One child dreams in critical condition,  
a lullaby of sirens and asphalt.

Trump tariffs tango with the Supreme Court,  
while Sudan drowns in landslide silence—  
1,000 gone,  
no headlines scream loud enough.

Giuliani breaks vertebrae and news cycles.  
China erases WWII like chalk from a blackboard.  
Indonesia riots over perks and dead delivery drivers.  
Nadler retires. RFK Jr. endangers.  
Israel accused of genocide by scholars who bleed ink.

Burning Man bleeds real this year—  
a pool of blood where art once stood.  
A child shot for ringing a doorbell.  
A church shooting garnished with pancakes and grief.

Gold hits record highs—  
because fear is the only currency left.

Powerball jackpot: $1.3 billion.  
But no one wins.  
Not really.

Language collapses under its own weight.  
Syntax screams. Meaning melts.  
This is not a poem. This is a rupture.  
This is the news, quantum-flayed and feral.

This is the sound of America eating itself alive.
