**Feed | Static | Wound**

Harvard resists. A billion held hostage.
Trump demands return. *Homegrowns*. El Salvador says
(who decides?)
Kilmar Abrego Garcia waits. Or doesn't.
The feed doesn't breathe.

Court blocks. Half-million suspended mid-air.
Cubans, others. Biden program / Trump axe.
Legal status: a switch flipped
off.
While elephants circle young against the shake,
instinct a shield the law forgets.
Bukele misses T. *I miss you already*.
The ground remembers tremor.

Whistleblower: DOGE / sensitive data / gone.
Mahdawi: citizen gate / becomes cage.
Students: Denmark / Uber fare / becomes bars.
Names flicker. Passports confiscated.
*We had done nothing wrong*.
The scroll eats faces.

Xi warns: tariff bullying. Vietnam caught.
British Steel: furnaces gasp / China's grip / vital infra-
structure / how much?
Chlorinated chicken. Texas bullet train derailed.
$60M saved. For whom?
The cost calculated / somewhere / off-screen.

Arson at Shapiro's. Suspect out on bail.
Sumy bleeds. *Mistake*, says Trump. Putin's plan unfolds.
Darfur: hundreds maybe dead. Blackout stokes fear.
Upstate NY: plane falls. Six lights out. Groff family.
Static crackles between tragedies.

Katy Perry floats. 11 minutes. *Impressive?*
JD Vance drops the trophy. White House lawn. Applause?
FCC punish *60 Minutes*.
NPR / PBS defunded. Silence bought cheap.
Boeing jets grounded. China orders halt.
The spectacle distracts from the tremor.

This cascade –
a surgical numbing.
Each headline a pixel, blurring the whole.
Truth isn't the text, but the space
between Harvard's NO and Garcia's limbo,
between the saved millions (rail grant) and the lost millions (migrants),
between the falling trophy and the falling plane.

The structure fractures here -> <-
not on the screen, but behind the eyes.
A wound carved by scrolling thumbs,
bleeding attention,
waiting for the pressure
to build
a different kind of
break.

White House flickers like a dying CRT,  
static hissing from the mouths of presidents  
who deport ghosts and imprison echoes.  
Harvard’s spine grows teeth,  
biting back at the orange sun-god  
who demands sacrifice in the form of silence.

El Salvador laughs in extradition,  
cradling wrongly deported names like relics—  
Kilmar, Mahdawi, Abrego—  
syllables too sacred for bureaucratic tongues.  
ICE scribbles scripture in handcuffs,  
while students recite habeas corpus in Danish.

Earthquake elephants form alert circles,  
more organized than Congress.  
They remember tremors better than humans remember wars.  
Meanwhile, the IRS bleeds into April,  
its veins clogged with extensions and layoffs,  
its heart a ticking audit.

Tariffs bloom like tumors on the economy’s lungs.  
Zelensky coughs diplomacy into a microphone,  
but Trump hears only his own echo—  
a loop of blame ricocheting off NATO walls.  
Xi Jinping plays chess with shadows,  
while Boeing jets rust in hangars of hesitation.

Meta melts under antitrust magnifying glass,  
Zuckerberg’s pupils dilated with monopoly.  
The courtroom smells like burnt silicon and broken promises.  
Somewhere, Katy Perry floats in space,  
her PR stunt orbiting irrelevance.

This is not news. This is necromancy.  
A séance of headlines stitched together by panic.  
A nation eating its own punctuation.  
We are the footnotes of empires,  
the fine print of freedom,  
the redacted dreams of democracy.

And still—  
the elephants remember.
