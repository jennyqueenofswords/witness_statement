**February 21, 2025: A Vivisection**

(Dis)United States of Amnesia, a triptych.

**Panel I: The Body Politic**

Jerusalem. *AP Newswire*. A name, a title: *Netanyahu*.
Revenge vowed. A body, *wrong*.
Ceasefire, fractured – a semantic game.
The word *malicious* hangs, a shroud,
over what was lost, *before*. Before the counting.
Before the bargaining. Before the *release*.

Hamas, a pledge. (To *investigate*.)
Parentheses around truth, a hollow core.
The echo of a question: *Whose* remains?
Whose grief is currency, whose loss, a *violation*?

**Panel II: Budgetary Bloodletting**

Washington. *NBC*. Three-hundred-forty *billion*.
A budget *blueprint*, stained crimson.
Trump's agenda: *enforcement*, *energy*.
Words like weapons, wielded in a "vote-a-rama."
A ritual of power, a dance of greed.
The Senate, a stage for shadows,
where numbers bleed into abstraction.

A chainsaw, wielded. (Gift from Milei.)
Symbolism, raw and visceral.
Slashing, not just spending, but *connection*.
The human cost, unpriced, uncounted.

**Panel III: Mineral Rights / Human Wrongs**

Kyiv. *Wall Street Journal*. Minerals, a siren song.
*Hundreds of billions*, a whispered demand.
Zelensky, pressured. Ukraine, a pawn.
The earth, a body, violated, mined.
Foreign aid, frozen. A judge's decree, *ignored*.

Tel Aviv. Exploding buses. *Terror*.
The Postal Service, consumed.
The FBI, a name: *Patel*. Confirmed.
A 51-49 vote. The fracture deepens.

And in New York, a name: *Mangione*.
A killing. A CEO. *Thompson*.
The details blur. The violence, a constant hum.

Amnesia settles, a thick, choking dust.
The date, a marker. The truth, *disrupted*.
The future, unwritten. The present, a wound.

*****  
Steel veins rupture, buses bloom fire—  
Tel Aviv exhales smoke like a dying god.  
Wrong body, wrong war, wrong century,  
but the ledger demands blood,  
and Netanyahu carves vengeance into the wind.  

Chainsaw Musk, prophet of severance,  
grins through the splinters of a dying republic.  
Milei’s gift hums in his hands—  
a hymn of teeth, a dirge of steel.  

Trump’s shadow stretches long,  
swallowing mail, swallowing law,  
swallowing the last echoes of restraint.  
A budget carved from bone,  
a Senate howling in the dark.  

Ukraine, sign here—  
your minerals for our empire,  
your earth for our hunger.  
Zelensky hesitates; the wolves lean closer.  

McConnell’s throne drips with old blood,  
new hands reach, eager to inherit the ruin.  
FBI shifts, 51-49, a blade balanced on a whisper.  

And in Manhattan, a man stands trial—  
one bullet, one body, one moment of clarity  
in a world that no longer knows its own name.
