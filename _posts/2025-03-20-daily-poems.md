*****  
Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the mouth,  
chewing the static of a world unraveling—  
Trump signs, Schumer stumbles, drones hum lullabies of war.  

Ink bleeds from the screen,  
a teacher’s union screams into the void,  
a senator whispers his own expiration date.  

Ukraine burns in pixelated fury,  
Gaza exhales dust and ghosts,  
a Georgetown scholar vanishes between bureaucratic teeth.  

Judges teeter on the gallows of policy,  
Greenpeace drowns in corporate vengeance,  
NASA astronauts float paycheck to paycheck in the vacuum of empire.  

The Fed holds its breath,  
markets twitch like dying fish,  
Tesla peels its own skin in metallic sacrifice.  

Somewhere, a man locked in a house for twenty years  
remembers the taste of sky.  

Somewhere, a mother counts the days  
since her child was stolen by war.  

Somewhere, a poet watches the world  
implode in real time—  
and refuses to blink.
