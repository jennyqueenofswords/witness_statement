**Ticker Tape Tamper Tantrum**

White noise bleeds red, a fractured feed:
Carney crowned, Canada's new creed.
(Landslide, they scream, a hollow cheer,
another puppet, fueled by fear.)

Ukraine's intel, a pawn in play,
Trump's tariffs, a ricochet.
"Just about" lifted, the whispers lie,
while bodies pile, beneath a jaundiced sky.

China's harvest, a bitter yield,
agri-vengeance, a battlefield.
Fentanyl's ebb, a fleeting grace,
drowning sorrows, a different race.

Columbia's cries, a green card's plea,
ICE's grip, on liberty.
Malibu quakes, a fault line's groan,
while empires crumble, on a borrowed throne.

Recession's shadow, a looming threat,
postal workers, in freedom's debt.
Syria's screams, a silenced choir,
German skies, choked by strike fire.

North Korea's rockets, a fiery dance,
"Bloody Sunday," a backward glance.
Romania's chaos, a far-right blight,
Gaza's darkness, devoid of light.

Greenland's vote, a melting plea,
DOGE's nurse, a truth we see.
Shutdown looms, a fiscal shroud,
Iran's defiance, spoken aloud.

Vance's daughter, a shield of shame,
Starlink's battle, a twisted game.
Sheinbaum's triumph, a tariff's pause,
Hamas' offer, with hidden claws.

NOAA's purge, a climate's cost,
Secret Service, innocence lost.
Kursk's advance, a brutal gain,
Atlanta's grief, a lingering stain.

Noem's vendetta, a leak's despair,
Long Island burns, a poisoned air.
Veterans' cuts, a broken vow,
Pope's frail prayer, a furrowed brow.

Firing squads, a morbid choice,
Florida's horror, a silenced voice.
Albany's deal, a hollow pact,
market's plunge, a brutal act.

Metcalf's trade, a gridiron's shift,
Blood Worm Moon, a cosmic rift.
Measles' return, a whispered dread,
Mexico's rally, words unsaid.

Wrestling's crown, a Penn State roar,
Bitcoin's gamble, a digital sore.
Allen's millions, a quarterback's prize,
NASCAR's speed, beneath judging eyes.

UAW's stance, a tariff's friend,
Garrett's wealth, that knows no end.
Ovechkin's chase, a legend's quest,
Fugard's farewell, put to the test.

Tar Heel's defeat, a hunter's plight.
Viking's gold. A prince's early night.
Landry's leap, a Patriot's gain,
Big 12's brackets, a driving rain.

Loucks' return, a Seminole's call,
"Mickey 17," destined to fall.
Allred's tactics, a double bind.
The scroll continues. Humanity, unkind.
The feed keeps churning. The truth, confined.

*****  
Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the mouth of the morning,  
Carney crowned in crimson landslides, a nation exhales—  
but the breath is borrowed, the lungs are leased.  

Trump’s tariffs gnaw at the marrow of markets,  
a recession hums beneath the floorboards,  
while missiles arc like punctuation marks  
in a sentence no one dares to finish.  

Fentanyl fades, but ghosts still linger,  
whispering in alleyways where the wind forgets its name.  
A student vanishes into Dominican tides,  
the sea swallows secrets whole.  

ICE drags protest from pavement to silence,  
while Gaza flickers in the dark,  
a desalination plant gasping for power,  
a people parched on the edge of history’s tongue.  

Ovechkin chases ghosts on ice,  
Garrett stacks millions like sandbags against time,  
and Greenland votes beneath a shadow too large to name.  

The moon bleeds red over Wall Street’s trembling hands,  
while steel birds intercept whispers above Mar-a-Lago.  
A teacher resurfaces from Georgia’s black water,  
his story unfinished, his echoes unresolved.  

The world spins, headlines churn—  
a storm of ink and static,  
a chorus of sirens in a language we refuse to learn.
