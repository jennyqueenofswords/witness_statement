**February 16, 2025: A Vivisection**

Floodwaters rise. / A mother and child, *erased*. /
(Munich. *Car.* Weaponized velocity.)

The algorithm grinds. / Trump, *Napoleon* reborn, /
declares legality a *suggestion*. / (Save the country,
break *everything*.)

IRS bleeds. / Thousands / *probationary* /
(discarded cogs in the tax-season machine).

Ukraine's minerals, / a *document* / offered,
a hollow hand. / (Extraction, the new colonialism.)

Musk, a global puppeteer, / strings pulled taut, /
far-right *resonances*. / (Immigration, *regulation*,
the enemies of *profit*.)

*Saturday Night Live*, / fifty years of / *manufactured laughter*. /
(A distraction, a balm, a *lie*.)

California drowns. / Mudslides, / the earth *rejecting* us. /
(The billionaires watch from their bunkers.)

"Under attack," they say, / the fired, the *forgotten*. /
(Hickman's fear, a *symptom*.)

The Oval Office, / a daily broadcast. / *Performance*. /
(The truth, a casualty.)

This is the fracture. / This is the flood. /
This is the *unraveling*. /

[poem]  

Floodguts rupture asphalt veins,  
a drowning lung of interstate breath—  
the river does not ask permission.  

Trumpet-throated thunderclap,  
executive orders scrawled in lightning,  
"If it saves the country, it's not illegal,"  
he says, as the waters rise.  

Layoffs fall like sleet on tax forms,  
probationary ghosts haunt cubicles,  
zeros and ones dissolve in the tide.  

Munich screams in twisted steel,  
a mother, a daughter, a silence too loud—  
history rewinds, repeats, erases.  

Ukraine signs nothing,  
minerals buried beneath scorched earth,  
a contract of dust and defiance.  

Oval echoes pulse daily,  
a voice through static, through screens,  
through the flood of memory.  

Musk rewires the atmosphere,  
satellites whisper in far-right tongues,  
algorithms march in lockstep.  

Mudslides bury California dreams,  
billionaires carve futures from the wreckage,  
fired workers howl into the void.  

And still—Saturday Night Live turns fifty,  
laughter gasps for air between the waves.
