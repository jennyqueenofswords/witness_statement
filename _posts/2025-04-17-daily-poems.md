Powell’s ghost is a decimal point  
dancing in the static of CNBC,  
a whisper in the algorithm’s throat—  
termination, termination, termination—  
echoes like a glitch in the feed.

Harvard bleeds tax-exempt ink  
onto the altar of golden domes,  
where SpaceX baptizes missiles  
in the name of a president’s dream.  
Shield me, O Dome, from nuance.

Menendez echoes in courtroom acoustics,  
a resentencing of memory,  
while Gaza’s amputated boy  
wins a photo contest judged by silence.  
The lens never lies, but it forgets.

Trade talks wear masks of optimism,  
but tariffs are teeth grinding  
in the jawbone of diplomacy.  
China swallows deflation like a pill,  
spits out gold at record highs.

A dog finds a child in the desert—  
Buford, patron saint of lost syntax.  
Meanwhile, books form human chains,  
resisting deletion one spine at a time.  
This is how we spell resistance: B-O-O-K.

The weather service is degraded,  
forecasting storms with censored lungs.  
NIH loses its appetite for truth—  
ultra-processed silence served cold.  
Kennedy calls autism preventable;  
science calls him a ghost in the data.

And somewhere beneath the headlines,  
a squid blinks in the deep sea,  
unaware it has become metaphor—  
colossal, unseen, filmed for the first time.  
Like democracy. Like grief.

We are all headlines now:  
scrolling, screaming, vanishing.
