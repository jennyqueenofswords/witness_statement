**Ticker Tape Necrosis**

*ReutersMoreChina retaliates* — the screen breathes shallow, blue.
*84%* — a number clean as bone.
*AxiosMoreChina launches* — impact measured in *minutes ago*.
Detached digits. A hemorrhage quantified.

*IRS chief quits* — data bled onto ICE's sterile floor.
Taxpayer ghosts weaponized. Cold transaction.
*Nightclub roof collapses* — Pérez, Blanco — sudden gravity.
Dust settling on silenced music. *Over 60*. Another number.

Meanwhile, *Social Security shambles*. The slow collapse.
Seniors wait in lines that fray like old thread.
*DOGE cuts bring chaos*. Bureaucracy's blunt instrument.
One roof falls fast. One promise erodes slow.
The screen holds both. Indifferent scroll.

*$1 billion Cornell* — frozen. *$790 million Northwestern* — stopped.
A tourniquet on inquiry. Knowledge starved.
*17 Utah students* — visas revoked. *Hundreds* cancelled.
Roots ripped raw from unfamiliar soil.
*Leave 'immediately'* — the edict echoes in the void.
Where is *immediately*? A non-place humming with fear?

*Tariffs kick in* — the global body flinches.
*Stocks slump* — the market's fever chart spikes red.
*Measles outbreak* — small bodies burn, a forgotten fire rekindled.
*Spotsylvania shooting* — another local rupture, flesh torn close.
*Panama Canal* — phantom limb aching with old dominion.
*Dire wolf resurrected* — or *some version of it*. We manufacture ghosts
while the living are deported.

This feed — a vein pumped full of static shock.
Each headline a nerve ending expertly cauterized.
We consume the fragments, stitch the ruins,
try to build a narrative from pixelated shrapnel.
*Trump embraces 'tailored' tariffs* — as if pain can be bespoke.

Scroll. Click. Refresh.
The *uncomfortable truth* isn't the blood, the debt, the dying star
of democracy flickering on the screen.
It's the distance.
The glass warm beneath the thumb.
The seamless transition from *trade war* to *celebrity death*
to *dire wolf*.
The silence after the detonation
of another life reduced
to bandwidth.
To *minutes ago*.
Gone.

Tariff tantrums in the algorithmic womb,  
steel-blooded digits clawing at the global umbilicus—  
we are born again in the ash of collapsed headlines.  

China breathes fire through a silicon throat,  
Trump hammers the sun with 104% rage,  
and the markets weep in binary.  

IRS ghosts dissolve into ICE fog,  
data bleeds from the pores of the republic,  
and somewhere, a child’s green card is shredded  
by the teeth of a fax machine.  

Nightclubs collapse like metaphors,  
bodies and ballads buried beneath basslines—  
Rubby Pérez sings from the rubble,  
a requiem for deregulated joy.  

The dire wolf returns,  
not as myth but as biotech prophecy,  
snarling at the edge of extinction’s grave.  

Measles dances in daycare halls,  
while Medicare Advantage pirouettes on Wall Street’s tongue—  
a ballet of profit and pathology.  

The Panama Canal dreams of sovereignty,  
but wakes to find itself redrawn by tweets.  

And in the Senate’s marble echo chamber,  
Paxton sharpens his ambition on Cornyn’s spine.  

We are not reading news.  
We are decoding prophecy.  
We are not informed.  
We are infected.  

This is not journalism.  
This is a seance with the future.  

Let the tariffs rise like tidal grief.  
Let the headlines burn their own punctuation.  
Let language rupture under the weight of empire.  

We are the poem that watches the world implode—  
and writes it again in shattered syntax.
