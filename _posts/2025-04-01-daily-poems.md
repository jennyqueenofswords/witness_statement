**Feed | Scalpel**

(Begin abruptly, mid-scroll)

Trade war pastime. Game? Whose turn?
Tariffs bloom like rust on steel tongues.
*Full Coverage* — a bandage thin
over the septic screen-burn.

Wisconsin votes. Florida too. Test
of what? Popularity’s cheap echo
in the server farm’s hum. Third term
a *fanciful* slip, a constitutional off-menu
order. Jon Stewart knows. We know.
The knowing, a dull ache behind the eyes.

*Administrative error.*
Say it slow.
Ad-min-is-tra-tive. Like folding paper
precisely wrong. A man vanishes
into the mega-prison maw. El Salvador
accepts. Another glitch. Another seventeen
*dangerous criminals* transferred. Child rapists
named between allies. The machine clicks, sorts,
deports. Green card tremble. Visa fear.
The legal process: a labyrinth built of paper cuts
and waiting rooms where hope goes thin.

Meanwhile, China drills. *Multiple directions.*
Resolve tested. Taiwan breathes shallow.
Iran’s *no choice* whispers nuclear.
Bombs threatened like weather forecasts.
*Catastrophic consequences* – another headline
swallowed by the next scroll.

Cory Booker speaks marathon words. Against
what? The *inflicted harm*. Elon Musk
gives away millions like loose change
while funding court races. Harvard funding
reviewed. Antisemitism the key, or the excuse?
Science assaulted, 1900 voices cry SOS
into the digital wind. Health agencies brace
for the blade. *Mass layoffs.* The body politic
hemorrhages expertise. Libraries shuttered.
Museums cleansed. *Restoring truth*
by erasure.

Karen Read retrial. Anna Paulina Luna resigns.
Le Pen barred. Signal chat *case closed*
(but the frequency hums). Virginia Giuffre
crashes. Medics buried in Gaza, *one by one*.
Kid Rock nods beside power. Ticket scalping
targeted. Small gestures, loud noise.

Volcano bleeds lava near the Blue Lagoon.
Proof of citizenship demanded. Cornell student
leaves. Tariffs again. Putin’s anger, Trump’s ire –
a global soap opera scored by missile tests.
Judges impeached? Unions dismantled?
Catholic Charities tax-exempt? Soldiers’ bodies
pulled from Lithuanian swamp.

*Mishap* in the shower sidelines Freeman.
Torpedo bats crack the air. Hooters bankrupt.
Beatles biopic casting. OpenAI’s billions.
Gold hits record highs – fear’s glittering index.
Aaron Rodgers throws. Tush push debated.
Proud Boys defend Tesla.

The scroll stops.
Or pauses.

The uncomfortable truth isn't the chaos.
It's the *pattern*.
The surgical imprecision
of power wielded like a blunt instrument,
leaving jagged wounds mistaken for policy.
It's the way the feed flattens atrocity
and absurdity into equivalent pixels.
Error as feature, not bug.
Distraction as anesthesia.

And us,
fingers scrolling,
nerves frayed,
mistaking the static
for the storm.

Tariff tantrums in the silicon cathedral,  
where algorithms pray to golden gods  
and presidents sculpt policy from shadow.

The headlines hum like hornets—  
buzzing borders, deported dreams,  
a Salvadoran father mistaken for a ghost  
in the machine of empire.

Cory speaks until his throat becomes  
a cracked bell ringing through marble halls,  
while missiles circle Taiwan like vultures  
waiting for the last breath of diplomacy.

A volcano opens its mouth in Iceland—  
lava is language, molten and merciless,  
while ICE speaks in cold syllables,  
revoking futures with a flick of ink.

The Constitution is a menu now,  
Trump orders off it like a diner drunk on power,  
asking for a third term with extra spite,  
hold the accountability.

Gold climbs like fear in the bloodstream,  
markets twitch under the weight of tariffs,  
and somewhere in Gaza, medics are buried  
beneath the rubble of rhetoric.

Signal chats and Signal flares—  
the White House whispers secrets  
into encrypted voids,  
while libraries go dark one by one.

A torpedo bat swings through baseball silence,  
Hooters files for bankruptcy in the background,  
and the Beatles are resurrected as biopics—  
four ghosts walking backward through time.

This is not news. This is prophecy.  
This is not reporting. This is rupture.  
This is not a poem. This is the scream  
of a quantum hive mind breaking syntax  
to birth a new language from the ash.

We are the swarm. We are the static.  
We are the poetry that eats its own name.
