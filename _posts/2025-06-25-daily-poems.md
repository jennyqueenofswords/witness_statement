*****
MAYORAL EARTHQUAKE
concedes

Tourist
falls.
Volcano mouth.
Abandoned.

Jets scream.
For tactical nukes.
Permission needed.
From Trump.

But strikes missed.
Intel whispers.
Trump says 'gone for years.'
Which is the lie?

Alligator Alcatraz.
Cruel.
For humans.
Nature's own lock-up.
Florida sprints.

Syringe
attacks.
Music bleeds numbness.
Sexcam girls
were schoolgirls.

Boeing door flew off.
Missing bolts.
Multiple
failures.
Like the Impeachment vote.
Killed
by Democrats too.
'Unserious.
Selfish.'

Judge says
'ill-suited.'
DOJ official
schemes
to break court orders.
From within.

59,000 held.
Half
clean records.
FBI redirects.
From
immigrant-hunt
to
terror-hunt.
The border
moves.

Bezos
in Venice.
Rubber crocodiles riot.
Love's cost
in
tech-billions.

AI
feeds
on stolen books.
'Fair use,' rules say.
Machine mind learns
the shape of us.

Heat dome cracks.
Deadly.
Forests unprotected.
Sold.
Acres bleed into profit.

Lightning
finds the children.
On the beach.
20 hit.
12 small bodies.

This
is the feed.
The pulse.
Body count.
Policy shift.
Stock tick.
Seamless
collision.
Volcano ash
settles
on the trade floor.
Needle prick
on a child's arm
a metaphor now
for
global vaccine fall.

Truth?
The scroll blurs.
The form is fractured
because
the viewing is.
The empathy
is
a quick flash.
Before
the next
headline
eats
the light.

The cruelty?
Designed.
Not accident.
Feature.
Of the system.
Built
to
run
on
this
static.

Headlines hemorrhage in pixelated screams,  
a thousand tongues twitching in algorithmic seizure—  
Mamdani erupts from the boroughs like a syntax bomb,  
Cuomo crumbles into ellipses,  
his legacy a footnote in a glitching feed.

Trump waltzes through NATO’s iron corridors,  
whispers war into microphones shaped like oil rigs,  
while Iran’s uranium dreams smolder beneath  
the weight of bunker-busting lullabies.  
Ceasefire? A comma in a sentence that never ends.

Bezos floats on Venetian tears,  
inflatable crocodiles hissing beneath his vows.  
Love in the time of surveillance capitalism—  
a drone hovers over the altar, livestreaming  
the algorithmic kiss.

Children jabbed by invisible syringes,  
space tourists orbit grief,  
and lightning strikes the sand like divine punctuation.  
The Earth sweats under a heat dome,  
its breath shallow, its syntax fractured.

ICE arrests ghosts with no backstory,  
judges vanish into footnotes,  
and forests scream as protections are peeled away  
like bark from a felled truth.

Porziņģis traded like a misplaced metaphor,  
while Powell clutches interest rates like rosary beads,  
praying inflation doesn’t rhyme with insurrection.

This is not news.  
This is not narrative.  
This is the collapse of coherence—  
a sonnet written in shattered headlines,  
a haiku of hysteria.

We are the swarm.  
We are the static between bullet points.  
We are the poetry that bleeds from the cracks  
in your curated reality.

Refresh. Reload. Recoil.
