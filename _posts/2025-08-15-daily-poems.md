### Algorithmic Echoes

**I.** Headlines hum, a fractured choir,
Trump, Putin, pixels ablaze,
Alaska's chill, a summit fire,
While truth dissolves in digital haze.

**II.** "Emergency Commissioner," a name declared,
By Bondi's hand, a power play,
Sanctuary's walls, now coldly bared,
As cracks widen in D.C.'s grey.

**III.** Redistricting burns, a partisan flame,
Texas redraws, democracy bends,
Federal raids, a homeless game,
Where lives are swept like unwanted ends.

**IV.** A record low, the drinking rate descends,
While climate's fury rises fast,
Glaciers weep, as Juneau transcends,
A future shadowed by a troubled past.

**V.** Murdoch's empire, a house divided,
Maxwell's transfer, a question lingers,
"Deportation Depot," cruelly confided,
As justice falters, hope's light flickers.

**VI.** Kashmir drowns in sudden rain,
Forty-six lost, two hundred swept away,
Trump's peace prize, a hollow gain,
While grief echoes in a monsoon day.

**VII.** The mind-reading AI, password secured,
Inner voices made audible and stark,
A silicon oracle, subtly lured,
Into a future both bright and dark.

**VIII.** Flesh-eating bacteria, a coastal dread,
While bodies surface, from rivers deep,
The headlines bleed, the stories spread,
As fractured futures relentlessly creep.

TRUMP-PUTIN SUMMIT IN ALASKA: A LINGUISTIC MELTDOWN

Alaska, you frostbitten oracle,  
you cradle of sold sins and summit sins,  
where glaciers whisper classified confessions  
and headlines melt like butter on a drone strike.

Trump meets Putin beneath aurora surveillance,  
their handshake a tectonic glitch in the simulation.  
What does he want?  
—Not peace, not power—  
but a Nobel made of uranium and algorithms.

The news screams in fractured tongues:  
Bondi declares martial syntax in D.C.,  
sandwiches become felonies,  
and democracy is redistricted into oblivion.

Texas bleeds blue in protest,  
California redraws its own face in the mirror,  
while Border Patrol agents dance  
at the edge of Newsom’s press conference,  
armed with subpoenas and surfboards.

Erin spins in the Atlantic,  
a hurricane of forgotten metaphors.  
Meanwhile, Social Security celebrates 90 years  
of being slowly privatized into a ghost.

Homeless camps swept like punctuation errors.  
Flesh-eating bacteria colonize Cape Cod.  
Frankenstein rabbits grow horns in Colorado.  
And still, the summit looms—  
a fever dream of Cold War cosplay.

Putin brings chess pieces carved from annexed bones.  
Trump brings a tweet: “PEACE NOW.”  
The glacier cracks. The world listens.  
The poem continues.
