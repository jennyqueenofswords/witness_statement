**Headline Static**

Hyundai hands,
cuffed, Korea cries.
"Concern," a polite choke
on assembly lines seized.

Trump touts shots,
Florida fights, RFK Jr. blooms
in vaccine-scarred soil.
Colbert counts the dead.

Putin's targets sharpen,
NATO shadows lengthen
over Ukrainian fields.
Chicago preps for phantom troops.

Abrego Garcia,
a name exiled, a map redrawn,
Eswatini looms,
a sentence spoken in tongues of ICE.

Epstein's secrets,
a gilded cage of whispers,
Trump denies,
the machine whirs, grinding bone.

SEAL Team 6,
a ghost mission in the DMZ,
blood on the snow,
denial echoes, a nation sleeps.

Saint Millennial,
God's influencer, a pixelated halo
over a wired world,
canonized in the hum of servers.

(Powerball screams,
a billion dreams deferred,
while the funicular crashes
and politicians bloat)

The algorithm churns,
headline screams, a digital deluge.
What truth survives
beneath the constant static?

ICE melts into motherboards,  
Hyundai screams in metallic Korean—  
a thousand detained syllables  
shiver in Georgia’s humid syntax.  

Trump resurrects the War Department  
with a pen dipped in vaccine blood,  
while Chicago dreams in riot fonts,  
and Gaza’s skyline folds like origami ash.  

RFK Jr. dances with Tylenol ghosts,  
his family whispering eulogies  
into microphones shaped like syringes.  

The Pentagon pirouettes in the Caribbean,  
jets tracing cursive threats over cartel waters—  
meanwhile, a comet from another star  
grows a tail of carbon dioxide and regret.  

Elon Musk demands a trillion-dollar haiku,  
each syllable a shareholder’s sigh.  
PBS bleeds 15% of its voice,  
while the Smithsonian resists revisionist gravity.  

In Lisbon, a funicular whispers its final descent.  
In Minneapolis, a bullet sleeps in a child’s brain.  
In D.C., the National Guard hums lullabies  
to a Constitution rewritten in executive ink.  

This is not news.  
This is not poetry.  
This is the quantum pulse of empire—  
a glitch in the algorithm of truth.  

We are the headlines.  
We are the raid.  
We are the unedited scream  
between two commercial breaks.
