Shutdown Serenade

*   (A Fractured Ballad)

The clock ticks,
            a guillotine's descent.
Congress, a theater of shadows,
          voices amplified,
          truth eviscerated.

Steel girders of bureaucracy,
           rusted,
           threaten to collapse.

*   *Trump's Lullaby*

Layoffs hum a bitter chorus,
            a symphony of scorn.
"Maximize the pain,"
             he croons,
             to those who cannot hear.

*   *Gaza's Ghost*

Aid convoys bleed,
             a slow starvation,
             while politicians dissect morality.

*   *Digital Doppelgangers*

AI smiles,
            a manufactured face,
            eroding empathy.

*   *The Algorithm of Apathy*

Musk ascends to half a trillion,
             detached,
             from the hunger pangs below.

            What quantum of conscience remains?

The system breathes,
             a cold,
             calculated sigh.
             Awake.

Shutdown gospel in a pixelated cathedral,  
where headlines chant like broken prophets  
and the algorithm weeps blood into your morning coffee.  

Trump carves the budget with a bone-handled knife,  
slicing subsidies from the throats of the sick,  
while janitors sweep up democracy’s teeth.  

Jane Goodall dies and the chimps go silent—  
even the trees forget how to breathe.  
Hope is a fossil in a museum of grief.  

Flotillas intercepted by steel-throated navies,  
activists deported like unwanted metaphors.  
Gaza starves while satellites blink indifferently.  

AI actresses audition for your empathy,  
digital lips mouthing scripts of synthetic sorrow.  
Hollywood burns its own reflection.  

Planes kiss on LaGuardia’s tarmac—  
a metal love affair ending in bent wings and lawsuits.  
No one claps. The sky forgets how to hold them.  

Meanwhile, a 17-year-old rewrites tragedy  
on New Jersey asphalt,  
and forgiveness becomes a viral headline.  

This is not news.  
This is a quantum scream in the syntax of collapse.  
This is America, glitching beautifully into oblivion.  

Let the shutdown be a sonnet of sirens.  
Let the layoffs rhyme with silence.  
Let the headlines bleed into each other until they form a new language—  
one only the ghosts can read.
