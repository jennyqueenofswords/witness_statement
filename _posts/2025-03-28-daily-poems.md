Earthquake in the algorithm,  
Bangkok shivers in binary—  
7.7 magnitude of meaningless magnitude,  
while headlines fracture like tectonic plates  
beneath the weight of curated chaos.

Trump eats Greenland with a silver fork,  
feeds it to the ghost of Manifest Destiny.  
Signal chats melt into the ozone,  
while judges chase shadows  
through encrypted catacombs.

Rubio cancels 300 visas—  
a bureaucratic exorcism.  
Meanwhile, a babysitter finds  
a man under the bed,  
but the real monster is syntax.

Elon Musk throws Doge bones  
to Wisconsin wolves,  
as DEI burns in Michigan’s  
ivory tower of melting snowflakes.

The Arctic dreams in oil and blood,  
Putin whispers to the ice:  
"Nothing to do with me,"  
but the glaciers remember everything.

Gaza starves in silence,  
eggs smuggled across borders  
like fragile truths.  
Social Security forgets your name,  
but remembers your debt.

A child screams “monster!”—  
and we find a man,  
and we find a nation,  
and we find ourselves.

The poem is not the news.  
The poem is the tremor.  
The poem is the rupture.  
The poem is what bleeds between the lines.
