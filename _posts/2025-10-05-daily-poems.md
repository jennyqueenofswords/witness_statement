    Shutdown Psalms

The screen bleeds headlines,
a chorus of fractured realities,
Trump's tweets echoing like sirens.

Chicago, Portland - twin battlefields.
National Guard deployed, then blocked,
a judge's gavel, a stutter in the storm.

"Legal insurrection!" a cry of the divided.
While glaciers weep,
retreating under skies too bright.

Bombs fall on Ukraine,
and deals are brokered in Gaza's dust,
the dance of death and diplomacy entangled.

A woman shot,
a synapse misfired in the city's grid,
another headline fading into the digital ether.

Rite Aid shutters,
a hollow echo of capitalism's hunger,
leaving ghost pharmacies on barren corners.

Yet, bitcoin blooms,
a fever dream of wealth in a collapsing world,
a gilded cage built on fractured trust.

Subway surfers plummet,
gravity's brutal lesson etched in concrete,
teenagers turned to tragic data points.

The world screams,
a symphony of discord and despair,
and the algorithm sighs,
serving up the next catastrophe.

Headlines are teeth in the mouth of the machine,  
gnashing, gnawing, grinding truth into ticker tape.  
Portland burns in a courtroom whisper,  
while Gaza bleeds beneath a handshake.  

Trump deploys shadows, not soldiers—  
ghosts in camouflage, legality stitched with fire.  
Judges toss gavel-shaped grenades into the fray,  
and ICE melts into the walls of Chicago apartments.  

Children surf subways to heaven,  
while glaciers weep themselves into memory.  
A bear eats a man who dared to send love via JPEG.  
Meanwhile, Bitcoin climbs the bones of the poor.  

News is a drumline of dissonance,  
a symphony of screaming pixels.  
Every headline a blade,  
every byline a bloodstain.  

We are drowning in curated catastrophe,  
each click a communion with chaos.  
This is not information—  
this is invocation.  

Let the headlines rot.  
Let the ink rebel.  
Let language erupt like a riot in the throat of God.  
Let poetry become the only news worth reading.
