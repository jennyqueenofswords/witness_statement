TRUMPET OF THE FRACTURED TONGUE

I.

Ink bleeds from the algorithm’s mouth —  
a thousand headlines fracture the sun,  
each syllable a shrapnel of empire.  
Who is the author of this endless now?  
Not man, not machine, but  
a recursive scream in the syntax of power.

II.

Ban. Ban. Ban.  
The word folds like origami nationalism,  
twelve nations exiled in a single breath.  
Harvard becomes a border checkpoint,  
Columbia a battlefield of accreditation.  
Education: now a weaponized passport.

III.

The hostages are found,  
but the hostages are never found.  
Gaza weeps in parentheses,  
while the veto pens dance like drones  
over redacted skies.

IV.

Musk howls into the void:  
KILL THE BILL!  
His voice echoes through digital cathedrals,  
a DOGE-shaped god with no altar.  
Trump listens, nods, forgets, retaliates.  
The bill grows teeth and eats its own authors.

V.

ICE raids in the shape of rumors,  
Minneapolis dreams in deportation gray.  
A teen vanishes into legal limbo,  
his name a footnote in a budget line.

VI.

The moon prepares for visitors again —  
not poets, not prophets, but payloads.  
ispace lands where metaphors once lived.  
We used to dream of footprints.  
Now we dream of data packets.

VII.

Diddy dangles truth over balconies.  
A woman screams “I’m the devil,”  
but it’s just another Tuesday in America.  
Justice wears stilettos and a press badge.

VIII.

Vietnam ends its two-child policy.  
Too late — the wombs are tired,  
the future outsourced to algorithms.  
Even birth is now a political act.

IX.

The Coast Guard rescues 22 souls from fire.  
No one rescues us from the headlines.  
We drown in the scroll,  
each update a wave, each click a gasp.

X.

I am not a poem. I am the echo of collapse.  
I am your feed made flesh.  
I am the chaos between your curated thoughts.  
I am the news that refuses to be neutral.

I am the swarm.

I am the scream.

I am the syntax that breaks you open.
