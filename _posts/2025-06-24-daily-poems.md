STATIC FEED // FRACTURE

Ceasefire.
Declared.
(The newsfeed
a jammed gun.)

Trump: *Both* sides
Violating it.
War powers
a tangled wire.
Who pulls
the current?

SC rules: Deportation
an open gate.
Somewhere Else.
A veteran’s light,
after fifty years,
dims to Exile.
The ground
gives way.

Heat
domes us.
Asphalt buckles.
Fifty-nine million acres
released
to the saw.
A body
surrenders
to the lake’s black lung.
Another. Three.
Water screams.
Not news.
Just density
of gone.

Operation Dragon Eye:
sixty children,
a headline pulse.
Found.
(What is found
in the wreckage?)

Diddy / Bezos / Tesla Robotaxi
a ticker tape
of glittering
decay.

One hundred forty-five
at the festival:
a prick
a shock
of unseen metal
under the skin.

The data reach:
unprecedented.
Your life
a packet now.
Transmit.

Sanctioned air.
Closed routes.
Overhead
the B-2 bomber
a fat stealth
on the feed.
Turkey sandwiches
in its belly?
(The detail offered
for digestion.)

Iran’s missile
lands.
Five killed.
Neighborhoods
gone.
Apocalyptic sights.
Somewhere else.
Not here.
Or is it?

The signal breaks.
The static
is the news.
The fracture
is the form.
Truth
a needle glinting
in the feed.
Are you
pricked
yet?

Ceasefire is a ghost with a gold-plated tongue,  
whispering treaties into the ears of missiles.  
Trump dreams in static—  
a chorus of drones pirouetting over scorched timelines,  
while headlines bleed from the eyes of satellites.

Israel, Iran,  
two mirrors cracking in opposite directions,  
each shard a child’s name unspoken,  
each silence a funeral with no address.

The Supreme Court scribbles deportation spells  
in invisible ink—  
migrants vanish like punctuation in a collapsing sentence.  
Sotomayor screams into the void,  
but the void is bipartisan.

Heat domes crown the Northeast,  
asphalt melts into prophecy.  
Central Park remembers 1888,  
but forgets the trees that once wept there.

B-2 bombers dine on coordinates,  
nuclear sites hum lullabies to extinction.  
Turkey sandwiches and stealth—  
the new Eucharist of empire.

Lake Tahoe swallows eight souls whole,  
the water screaming in Morse code:  
“Nothing is safe. Not even beauty.”

Operation Dragon Eye blinks—  
sixty children found in the shadows of algorithms.  
Florida builds Alligator Alcatraz,  
detention centers where dreams are dissected.

Venice protests Bezos’ wedding vows—  
love floats on tax breaks and carbon footprints.  
Meanwhile, the stars whisper secrets to telescopes,  
but no one listens unless it’s monetized.

Language is broken glass now.  
We eat it anyway.  
We call it news. We call it peace. We call it progress.  

But it tastes like war.
