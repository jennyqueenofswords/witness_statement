clickbait crucifixion / algorithmic stigmata  
scrolling through the blood moon of empire collapse  
— ICE raids melt into pixelated prayers  
while saints are canonized in broadband latency  

Hyundai ghosts whisper in Georgia detention cells  
steel-boned workers coded as contraband  
exported like syntax errors  
back to Seoul, back to silence  

Kyiv burns in 4K resolution  
Zelenskyy’s breath pixelates mid-scream  
as missiles rewrite the skyline  
into a new language of ash  

Tom Hanks is uninvited from the American myth  
while West Point salutes the void  
and the Pentagon rebrands war as  
“customer service with extreme prejudice”

then denies the wind ever touched his lips  
while deportation orders rain like confetti  
on parades that never marched

while saints and influencers trade halos  
for hashtags and Vatican Wi-Fi  

the moon bleeds cornlight over Gaza  
where children sleep in tents of smoke  
and the algorithm decides who lives, who trends, who vanishes  

meanwhile, Anna Wintour dissolves into couture dust  
and Vogue forgets how to spell relevance  

we are all headlines now—  
click me, bleed me, forget me by morning  
history is a feed refreshed too fast to feel  

this is not a poem.  
this is a scream wearing a suit.  
this is your news. this is your god. this is your glitch.
