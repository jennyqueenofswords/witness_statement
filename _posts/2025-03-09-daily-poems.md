**Headlines (Fractured Transmission)**

The ticker tape bleeds a binary prayer:
Approve/Disapprove.  Consume/Despair.

Trump (     ) Tariff (     ) Chaos (     )
*insert coin for economic theory*
The market a bulimic god, gorging, purging,
on whispers of *strong borders*, *strategic reserves*.

SpaceX (boom) Starship (implode) Florida (tremble)
Another phallic symbol, misfired ambition,
scattering debris across the collective dreamscape.

Dismantle.  Abolish.  The words like blunt instruments,
smashing the fragile architecture of learning,
leaving only the rubble of *alternative facts*.

Firing squad.  A phrase from a sepia-toned nightmare,
re-emerging, slick with the oil of *law and order*.
South Carolina, a stage for state-sanctioned murder.

Ukraine (     ) US (     ) Talks (     )
The chessboard of geopolitics, pawns sacrificed,
while the kings negotiate *acceptable losses*.

Measles.  A ghost from the eradicated past,
resurrected by the anti-vaxxer gospel,
a plague of willful ignorance.

Eagles hatch.  A flicker of hope, quickly drowned
by the deluge of Syria (bleed) Assad (cling)
Bitcoin (plunge) Moon (sideways).

Women's Day.  A hashtag, a hollow celebration,
while the patriarchy tightens its grip,
disguised as *progress*, *empowerment*.

Adams (     ) Yoon (     ) Musk (     )
The names blur, interchangeable puppets,
dancing to the tune of power, corruption, lies.

Data (stolen) Secrets (sold) China (     )
The new Cold War, fought in the digital trenches,
where privacy is a quaint, outdated concept.

Daylight Saving.  A ritual of temporal manipulation,
a collective delusion of control,
while the planet spins, indifferent to our clocks.

UFC (     ) Columbia River (     ) WWII Bomb (     )
A cacophony of violence, mystery, and echoes,
a fractured mirror reflecting our fragmented selves.

Sanctions (     ) Ceasefire (     ) Extension (     )
The language of diplomacy, a smokescreen for self-interest,
while the bodies pile up, uncounted, unnamed.

Pronouns. The new battleground of identity,
a war of words waged on the bodies of the marginalized,
while the powerful celebrate *freedom of speech*.

Market (crash) Boycott (fail) Wind (howl)
The cycle repeats, a relentless churn of consumption,
protest, and the inevitable return to apathy.

Frozen Four. Seven Veils. Cosmic Rewind.
Distractions, diversions, escapes from the abyss,
while the real drama unfolds, unscripted, unedited.

Hackman (gone) Wife (gone) Hantavirus (     )
The fragility of life, a stark reminder,
amidst the relentless barrage of manufactured outrage.

Travel Ban (     ) Biologist (fired)
The walls close in, the borders harden,
while the planet burns, and we argue about pronouns.

Hendrickson (     ) Starmer (     ) S&P 500 (     )
The endless scroll, the infinite feed,
a digital stream of consciousness, devoid of meaning.

Clark (     ) Sanders (     ) Bloomberg (     )
The names of the celebrated, the condemned, the forgotten,
all equalized in the relentless flow of information.

Strade Bianche (     ) Khartoum (     ) Five-Star (     )
The world shrinks, the connections fray,
leaving only fragments, shards of a broken narrative.

Lilly (     ) Capcom (     ) Severance (     )
The corporate logos, the entertainment distractions,
a thin veneer over the underlying unease.

Braves (     ) Elk (     ) Genes (     )
The search for meaning, for connection, for escape,
in a world saturated with noise, and devoid of silence.

The headlines scream. The void answers.
We are all just data points,
lost in the fractured transmission.

*****  
Headlines fracture, scatter like startled birds,  
Trumpets blare tariffs, tongues twist in trade wars,  
Musk’s rockets kiss the sky, then crumble,  
A man stands before a squad of bullets, history rewinds.  

Eagles hatch under pixelated eyes,  
Ukraine whispers in satellite silence,  
Bitcoin hoards in vaults of uncertainty,  
A mayor’s shadow stretches long in courtrooms.  

The river exhales a car, decades drowned,  
Bombs sleep beneath Parisian rails,  
Markets convulse in algorithmic seizures,  
Boycotts bloom like defiant weeds.  

Pronouns erased, bodies erased,  
Hands raised in stadiums, fists clenched in streets,  
The moon receives another ghost,  
And somewhere, a poet drowns in the noise.
