**White Noise Static**

The ticker tape of tragedy unfurls,
a scroll of soundbite suffering.
Trump, Musk, a Pope in peril,
stockpiles of crypto, digital offerings.

Each headline a hammer blow,
a fractured mirror of the now.
SpaceX explodes, a fiery show,
while tariffs twist, and markets bow.

(We are drowning in the data stream,
a flood of fear, a broken dream.)

South Carolina's firing squad, a choice,
a bullet's ballet, silencing a voice.
Measles blooms, a crimson tide,
while unemployment's numbers hide

the hollow ache, the empty plate,
the human cost, the sealed-shut gate.

(The algorithm of anguish spins,
a web of woe, where no one wins.)

Syria bleeds, a crimson stain,
while Bitcoin's promise turns to pain.
Alaska's snow, a frozen tomb,
a chilling echo in the newsroom's gloom.

Idaho's texts, a whispered dread,
a tapestry of violence, words unsaid.

(We are the ghosts in the machine,
consuming horrors, unseen, obscene.)

The Education Department, torn apart,
a fractured future, a broken heart.
Walgreens swallowed, privatized and sold,
another story, bought and controlled.

And through it all, the constant hum,
of *more*, *more*, *more*, until we're numb.
A fractured syntax of despair,
a world on fire, beyond repair.

The white space screams.
The silence breaks.
The truth remains.
The system…*quakes*.

*****  
Headlines fracture, scatter like startled birds,  
Trump’s echoes ricochet through the halls of power,  
a tariff teeters, a speech unspools,  
SpaceX ignites, collapses, rises again—  
a phoenix or a firework?  

The Pope breathes, the Pope prays,  
the Pope remains.  
A firing squad loads history into its chamber,  
South Carolina exhales gunpowder ghosts.  

Ukraine burns in the margins of diplomacy,  
a ceasefire whispers but never speaks.  
Bitcoin stockpiles in the vaults of empire,  
Musk laughs in the face of combustion.  

Gene Hackman waits in the quiet of grief,  
while the Nasdaq stumbles over its own shadow.  
Measles resurfaces like an old enemy,  
the past refuses to stay buried.  

Somewhere, a train halts for a bomb that never exploded,  
somewhere, a river surrenders a car full of ghosts.  
Somewhere, a judge reads threats like morning headlines,  
somewhere, a child wakes up hungry for a future.  

The world spins forward, backward, sideways—  
newsprint smears beneath trembling fingers.  
What is history but a collection of yesterday’s alarms?  
What is truth but the space between headlines?
