**Ticker Tape Apocalypse**

CNBC *screams* Nasdaq *bleeds* correction.
Trump, the tariff-twitching phantom,
pauses, unpauses, a spasmodic god
of market chaos. Mexico, Canada,
caught in the crossfire of his whim.

The Pope, a fragile metronome,
ticks between prayer and pathology.
*Gradual, slight improvement.*
(Is grace quantifiable?)

Zelenskyy, a ghost in the machine of war,
begs for defense, for dialogue,
while Europe re-arms, a rusty beast
awakened by the scent of blood.

China scolds, *two-faced* America,
a pot calling the kettle a shattered mirror.
Foreign aid, a pawn in the Supreme Court's game,
Justice Barrett, the fulcrum of fate.

Daylight Saving Time, a manufactured theft,
stealing sleep, offering free food
as a pathetic consolation prize.
*Spring forward,* they say, into what abyss?

Shutdown or surrender? The Senate's dilemma,
a binary choice in a fractal world.
Germany's debt, a *bazooka* aimed at the future,
while South Korea bombs its own citizens, a tragic farce.

Federal workers, fired in digital droves,
Elon Musk, the scapegoat, the DOGE-devourer,
claiming innocence in the face of mass unemployment.
*DOGE cuts*. A new euphemism for oblivion.

Firing squads in South Carolina, a medieval spectacle,
while Ukraine's satellite eyes are blinded by American greed.
Syria, a charnel house of forgotten rebellions,
Adnan Syed, a ghost released from the prison of narrative.

Measles, a resurrected plague,
thriving on ignorance and fear.
Job numbers, a flickering illusion,
*151,000 jobs added,* while the economy unravels.

Trump hides something in Ukraine,
a secret whispered in the Kremlin's ear.
Gene Hackman, dead, a footnote to hantavirus,
while lunar landings stumble, sideways, again.

Democrats, lost in a wilderness of resistance,
memes and mockery their only weapons.
An Olympian drug lord, a $10 million bounty,
Bitcoin reserves, a digital pyramid scheme.

Idaho murders, a text message scream, *freaking out,*
echoing in the void of a shattered home.
South Korea's president, freed from detention,
a puppet dancing on the strings of power.

India's tariffs, *very high,* Trump complains,
a prelude to more economic warfare.
Eric Adams, a mayor dodging corruption charges,
while national parks are gutted, their guardians exiled.

Orbán, the Hungarian autocrat,
blocking aid to Ukraine, a pawn in Putin's game.
Law firms, targeted for aiding Trump's enemies,
Walgreens, a fallen giant, devoured by private equity.

Farmers, caught in the crosshairs of trade wars,
their loyalty tested by economic ruin.
Classified data, sold to China,
a betrayal whispered in the digital wind.

Black Lives Matter Plaza, erased,
a symbol of surrender to white supremacy.
Slender Man's victim, released, a ghost in the machine,
while Trump lies about Social Security, a broken promise.

UFC, a spectacle of violence,
a distraction from the crumbling world.
Michigan State, a fleeting victory,
while Social Security is branded a Ponzi scheme.

Netanyahu, a shadow over October 7th,
a tragedy foretold, a warning ignored.
Pilots flirting with influencers,
a trivial pursuit in the face of global collapse.

Lesotho, a nation mocked, a symbol of ignorance,
while Ovechkin chases Gretzky's ghost.
Curry's magic, a fleeting moment of beauty,
in a world drowning in despair.

DEI, a battleground of corporate culture,
while European stocks surge, a false dawn.
Lakers and Knicks, a clash of titans,
a distraction from the unraveling fabric of reality.

AOC, mocked for her digital resistance,
while a WWII bomb disrupts Paris, a ghost of the past.
Transgender youth, targeted by hate,
while a missing woman is found in a suitcase, a tragic end.

Russia's missiles, a rain of fire,
while Seahawks trade Metcalf, a pawn in the game.
Hoaxes and diversions, a constant stream of noise,
while DOGE staffers feast on taxpayer dollars.

*Mickey 17*, a clone's lament,
a reflection of our own fractured identities.
Trump's sanctions, a weapon of mass confusion,
while Pamela Bach, a forgotten star, fades away.

Joey Bosa, a commodity, traded and bartered,
while Brock Nelson finds a new home in the Avalanche.
Zelenskyy's truce, a desperate plea,
while CNN is stunned by DOGE's popularity.

The S&P 500, a rollercoaster of fear,
while RFK Jr. peddles snake oil for measles,
a symptom of a world losing its mind.
The headlines scream, a cacophony of chaos,
a ticker tape apocalypse, unspooling in real time.

*****  
Headlines crack like brittle bones,  
tariffs tangle in a lover’s quarrel,  
a Pope exhales slow prayers through hospital glass,  
while Europe sharpens its teeth on the edge of war.  

Trump’s shadow stretches across the market,  
a hand of tariffs, a fist of sanctions,  
China snarls, Russia strikes,  
the world spins dizzy on the axis of power.  

A moonshot lands sideways,  
a fighter jet bombs its own people,  
a missing woman folds into a suitcase,  
history loops like a snake eating its own tail.  

Measles bloom like forgotten ghosts,  
a snowboarder turns kingpin fugitive,  
Elon Musk shrugs beneath congressional glare,  
and the stock market wails in algorithmic agony.  

Somewhere beneath the noise,  
a mother tucks her child into bed,  
a poet scribbles in the margins of collapse,  
and the world—  
for one breath—  
pauses.
