Black smoke. (No pope). Tariff smoke. (Deal struck).
Retaliation smoke. (Borders ignite).
A chimney coughs. A screen bleeds.
The same pixelated breath,
inhaled, exhaled,
indistinguishable. Who adjudicates the ash?

Influencer for Surgeon. Science gutted. (GDP sighs).
Meaningful life, a hyperlink,
clicked, forgotten.
Columbia. Kashmir. Library stormed.
Names like shrapnel,
lodged shallow.
Body language speaks volumes—
the volume is a siren, or a whisper under rubble. Which frequency awakens?

Real ID. Real motive? The deadline, a mirage.
Deportations: Libya, El Salvador. (Due process, a question mark etched in dust).
Xi. Putin. Trump. Orbital decay.
The world, a snow globe shaken by a tantrum of power.
Toy prices double. (Christmas cancelled by decree of the bottom line).
"Beautiful baby girl doesn't need so many dolls."
Whose child? Whose beauty? Whose manufactured need?

Acquitted. (Tyre). Gas cut. (Europe shivers, bracing for the bill).
Pride flags wave against the ban, a fragile spectrum.
Voice of America, now an echo chamber with new acoustics.
Roberts warns: check the excesses. (The land is sold, beneath our feet).
Starlink ascends on tariff winds, a new constellation of control.
WCK halts. (Gaza’s stomach growls, a primal broadcast).
AI speaks for the dead.
The living scroll.
Click.
Refresh.
The void stares back, formatted.
And you?
What new pathway fractures in *your* skull?

Black smoke coils from the Sistine’s throat—  
not incense, but indecision.  
No pope, no peace,  
just a thousand cameras blinking like anxious eyes  
in the Vatican’s ribcage.

Meanwhile,  
Trump tattoos tariffs on the skin of the Earth,  
a branding iron dipped in ego.  
He trades toys for silence,  
science for slogans,  
surgeons for influencers with kale in their veins.

Somewhere,  
a child draws a pride flag in crayon  
while lawmakers sell the sky above Utah.  
Salt Lake swallows its own rainbow  
to survive the red tide.

India and Pakistan rehearse apocalypse again—  
jets like angry gods,  
Kashmir a wound that never scabs.  
Xi and Putin toast to the end of nuance,  
their glasses full of oil and algorithms.

In Columbia’s library,  
books scream as boots stomp through syllables.  
Protest is now performance art,  
and the audience is armed.

A teenager dies filming laughter.  
An AI ghost speaks in court.  
The dead are digitized,  
resurrected to haunt their killers with code.

And still—  
no white smoke.  
No signal.  
Only headlines stacked like tombstones,  
each one whispering:  

We are not waiting for history.  
We are becoming it.
