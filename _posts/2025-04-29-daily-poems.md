**Feed/Fracture**

Carney prepares. Mantle. West. Anti-Trump.
Trump. 100 days. Weird. Numbers. F.
Dictator? Poll says. Dangerous? Poll says.
*Break us.* He says.
The screen flickers. Another name. Another power surge.

Spain dark. Candlelight stains Madrid. No showers.
Then Chatham. Four children. After-school. Vehicle.
Through.
Wall.
Gone.
(Full Coverage) links below the small print absences.
Between blackout theories and tariff threats,
a silence shaped like tiny shoes.

Deepfake nude. Congress passes. TAKE IT DOWN.
(Major Flaws) whispers the footnote foundation.
A digital ghost limb twitches on the server farm.
Amazon seeds the sky: Kuiper eyes. Compete. Watch.
Nvidia / Huawei. Chip war cold bloom.
REAL ID looms. Prove the pulse behind the pixels.

Columbus Day. Ashes. Back. (Never Canceled).
Redskins name. Not looking back. (Whose gaze averted?)
Climate authors. Dismissed. Erase the rising water line.
Penn swimmer. Erase the record. Title IX violation.
History rewritten in memo lines,
policy drafts,
deleted files.

Putin ceasefire. 3 days. *Manipulation.* Zelensky says.
Trump demands permanent.
Jet ($60M) slips overboard. Red Sea swallows steel.
Noem’s purse. Found. Suspects. (Undocumented?)
Headlines collide – shrapnel storm –
each fragment sharp, none connect
except here, in the overwhelmed circuit
behind the eyes.

Scroll. Refresh.
The ticker-tape dread.
Justice Dept. Exodus. Civil Rights hollowed.
Commanders Home. RFK campus activated. Opportunity. (180 acres).
Truckers must speak English. Commonsense. (Whose?)
Orthodox mob chases woman. Brooklyn screams.
PFAS forever in the water table, the blood stream.

This isn't news.
It's the nervous system of a world mid-seizure,
each twitch broadcast live.
We mainline the static,
call the numbness *informed*.
The disruption isn't the point.
The point is the precision cut
through the scar tissue,
hoping something underneath
still bleeds
awake.

Mark Carney dreams in maple static,  
his suit stitched from the torn flags of empires—  
Trump’s shadow slithers across the 49th parallel,  
whispers tariffs into the ears of sleeping moose.

Polls are bloodstains on the Constitution,  
a child’s crayon drawing of democracy  
hung crooked in the gallery of collapse.  
Canada votes with frostbitten fingers,  
while America screams into its own algorithm.

A car crashes through childhood in Chatham—  
four futures erased like typos in a godless script.  
Meanwhile, satellites bloom like metal flowers,  
Amazon’s Kuiper petals chasing Musk’s ghost  
through the vacuum of monetized sky.

The Pope retires into a conclave of smoke and silence,  
while AI chips whisper in Mandarin,  
and Shedeur Sanders falls through the draft like a prayer  
no one wanted to answer.

Deepfakes dance in Congress,  
revenge porn wrapped in legislative lace.  
The Supreme Court debates the price of a wrong door,  
while a Navy jet drowns in the Red Sea,  
its wings folded like forgotten origami.

This is not news.  
This is the fever dream of a nation  
with its eyes sewn open by executive orders.  
This is a scream wearing a necktie.  
This is poetry made from headlines—  
a mosaic of madness,  
a gospel of glitch.

We are all just footnotes now,  
scrolling toward oblivion.
