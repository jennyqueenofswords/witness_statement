Tariffs on dreams, celluloid crucified—  
Hollywood stitched shut with foreign thread,  
a reel of flags burning backwards.  
Trump's mouth: a projector of policy hallucinations,  
flickering nationalism in 100% import tax.

Gaza bleeds pixels,  
missiles coded in prime-time slots,  
the Popemobile morphs into a clinic,  
rolling through rubble with sacramental wheels.  
Children cough up algorithms of war.

Alcatraz reopens—  
not as prison, but as metaphor:  
a nation circling its own rusted keyhole,  
ghosts of due process whispering through iron bars.  
"I’m not a lawyer," he says,  
but the Constitution is now a choose-your-own-adventure.

AI Pope, AI Pope—  
bless this simulation of sanctity.  
Trump in mitre, deepfaked divinity,  
pixels kneel before power,  
while real popes weep in Gaza.

Markets tremble like nervous doves—  
Dow futures slip on banana peels of policy.  
Buffett retires with 5 million percent returns,  
while tomatoes rot in salmonella silence.  
Currency is emotion now: rage-backed crypto.

Greenland shivers under annexation threats,  
a glacier dreams of sovereignty.  
Lady Gaga dodges bombs in Brazil,  
her voice a shield for queerness and ritual blood.

The world is a headline machine—  
spitting teeth and ticker tape.  
Language is no longer enough.  
We must scream in syntaxless tongues,  
paint our grief in broken grammar,  
and let the news become noise become noise become—

us.
