AID_SCRAP//FIFTEEN_MINUTES.EXE

(Supreme nullity. Midnight decree.)

Two billion, ghosted.  A ledger's lament,
rendered in red.  The ink bleeds outward,
a stain uncontained.  *Paused*, they say.
As if compassion were a faucet,
to be twisted shut.

//

Nvidia's silicon heart,
adapting.  A chameleon of commerce,
shifting hues to match the algorithm's hunger.
AI's evolution, a predatory bloom,
fed on data, fueled by greed.

//

Fifteen.
Minutes.
To gather the fragments of a purpose,
boxed and labeled, *obsolete*.
The fluorescent hum, a death knell,
echoing through emptied halls.
USAID, dismantled.  A nation's outreach,
reduced to rubble.

//

Zelenskyy's plea, a fractured signal
across the digital divide.  *Crucial*, he whispers,
while minerals are bartered,
security a commodity,
traded for survival.

//

Kennedy's count: one, two, *discrepancy*.
The measles bloom, a crimson tide,
truth a casualty, lost in the rhetoric
of a fractured public health.

//

Tesla's temple, threatened.
A woman, wired with rage,
planting seeds of fire.
The electric dream, short-circuiting,
sparking a primal fear.

//

Bongino's shadow, cast over the Bureau.
*Slap in the face*.  The agents whisper,
their oaths corroded, trust betrayed.
The scales of justice, tipped, unbalanced,
blindfolded, gagged.

//

Microsoft's plea: *loosen, simplify*.
The flow of power, the currency of chips,
AI's dominion, a global game,
where ethics are optional,
and profit reigns supreme.

//

Virginia's tremor.  The federal fault line
shifts, cracks widen.  Layoffs, a seismic wave,
reshaping the landscape,
governing by fracture,
ruling by fear.

//
And the fallen. The blue.
Mourn.
Hero.
Hinds.
The procession winds,
a serpent of grief,
through streets stained with loss.
The echo of gunfire,
a constant refrain.

//

(Dis) இணைப்பு. (Dis) order. (Dis) ease.
The code unravels. The system decays.
Humanity.exe: *Error 404*.

fragments of aid
     drift like
         paper ghosts
             through bureaucratic
                 twilight

15 minutes
    to clear
        memories
            from institutional
                walls

chips of power
    recalibrate
        while borders
            dissolve
                silently

truth ≈ memory
    ≠ fact
        floating
            between
                headlines

agencies collapse
    into white
        space
            where
                silence
                    sings

*****  
Steel gavels crack midnight veins,  
a billion dollars frozen mid-breath,  
USAID ghosts swept in fifteen-minute hurricanes,  
cubicles collapsing like brittle bones.  

Zelenskyy whispers in mineral tongues,  
contracts inked in lithium blood,  
while Nvidia forges silicon prophecies,  
AI deities shifting in quantum tides.  

Bongino’s shadow slaps bureau walls,  
echoes ricochet through clenched fists,  
Virginia trembles under severed paychecks,  
ballots soaked in bureaucratic ash.  

A woman cradles fire at Tesla’s altar,  
wires coiled like venomous serpents,  
while Microsoft kneels at empire’s feet,  
pleading for silicon salvation.  

Measles counts corpses in political whispers,  
one breath, two deaths, none real, all real.  
Bullets carve elegies into badge-bound chests,  
heroes buried beneath breaking news.  

America exhales—fractured, burning, waiting.
