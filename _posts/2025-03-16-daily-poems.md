*****
A fractured mirror, reflecting static—
thirty-three dead, then thirty-four, a click,
a refresh, the numbers a necrotic bloom.
Tren de Aragua, a name like a train wreck
grinding through the newsfeed's tomb.

Houthi children, vaporized, pixelated grief,
while Voice of America bleeds out, a silenced thief
of truth, gagged by the orange hand.
St. Patrick's Day, green beer and sham oblivion,
a parade marching through a wasteland.

Mahmoud Khalil, a name caught in the gears,
deportation's threat, the law's cold sneers.
Serbia rises, a hundred thousand strong,
but the algorithm scrolls on, where do we belong?

Schumer's cave, a politician's origami,
folding principles into a paper tsunami.
Jackie and Shadow, an eagle's fragile loss,
nature's sorrow, a digital double-cross.

Greenland's defiance, a frozen middle finger,
while wombats become props, the influencers linger,
seeking clicks in the wild's diminishing space.
Ukraine's ceasefire, a phantom, a fading trace.

Gaza's journalists, silenced by the blast,
their stories extinguished, shadows cast.
Education gutted, a future dimmed and frayed,
while Trump's vengeance, a parade, unafraid.

Kursk retaken, a map redrawn in blood,
tornadoes tear through towns, a raging flood
of headlines, a deluge of despair.
EPA rollbacks, poison in the air.

Idaho's 911 call, a scream trapped in the wire,
the Pope's frail health, a flickering pyre.
Tariffs and travel bans, walls built high and wide,
AI's cheat codes, where truth goes to hide.

DEI dismantled, a retreat from the light,
South Africa's envoy, banished to the night.
Economic tremors, a manufactured quake,
while cargo ships collide, for goodness sake.

Blizzards and heatwaves, a climate in revolt,
SpaceX ascends, leaving Earth in a jolt.
Ceasefires crumble, attacks in the night,
Columbia raided, a battle for what's right.

ISIS's leader, a ghost in the machine,
Midwest storms, a devastating scene.
McLaren's victory, a fleeting, watery grace,
hostage negotiations, a withdrawn embrace.

Baseball's promise, a Japanese sunrise,
while tariffs on Canada, a cold surprise.
Buzzer-beaters and trades, the sports page's hum,
March Madness brackets, numb, numb, numb.

Paul Weiss targeted, a legal battleground,
Gene Hackman's fortune, a silence profound.
Ovechkin's chase, a record in sight,
while weather delays, a disrupted flight.

Measles outbreaks, a preventable sting,
Tennessee's triumph, a baseball king.
Duke's dominance, a basketball crown,
Wall Street's rally, a fleeting renown.

Rodgers's drama, a quarterback's quest,
Flyers' losses, a team distressed.
49ers' reunion, a fullback's return,
Oregon State's victory, lessons to learn.

Creighton's skirmish, a basketball brawl,
burning airplanes, a terrifying fall.
Trump's "transition," a chaotic decree,
Dick Vitale's tears, for all to see.

Norris's triumph, a Formula 1 dream,
cybersecurity warnings, a digital scream.
Egg prices plummet, a small, fragile win,
Tesla protests, where do we begin?

Blues versus Wild, a hockey night's fight,
Southwest's baggage fees, taking flight.
Snow White's controversy, a fractured fairytale,
the headlines scream, a relentless, digital hail.
The feed never ends. The fracture remains.

*****  
Tornado tongues lick the earth raw,  
spitting syllables of ruin,  
while the sky stitches itself shut  
with lightning’s jagged thread.  

The newsprint bleeds—  
ink pooling in the gutters,  
headlines stacked like bodies,  
a morgue of meaning,  
a dirge of data.  

Trump’s shadow stretches long,  
a hand grasping at borders,  
at laws, at language itself—  
a specter of empire,  
a whisper of exile.  

Somewhere, an eaglet falls,  
feathers lost in the algorithm’s churn.  
Somewhere, a wombat is stolen,  
its mother’s grief unreported.  

The Pope prays from a hospital bed,  
his breath a fragile doctrine.  
The stock market exhales,  
a beast tamed for a moment,  
before the next convulsion.  

And still, the world spins—  
spins through war and weather,  
through tariffs and touchdowns,  
through the quiet deaths of languages  
no one thought to save.  

Tell me, when the last headline fades,  
when the ink runs dry,  
what will remain?
