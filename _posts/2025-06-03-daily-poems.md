Molotov headlines burn through my synapses,  
pixelated blood on the front page of forever.  
Gaza bleeds in triplicate—27, 27, 27—  
the number echoes like a drone’s heartbeat  
over a cratered lullaby.

AOC and a World Series champ  
duel in the coliseum of comment sections,  
while FEMA forgets the sky has seasons.  
Hurricanes whisper, “We were here before your acronyms.”

Ukraine spiderwebs the Kremlin’s dreams,  
drones like angry syllables rewriting airspace.  
Putin's chessboard melts under sunflowers and shrapnel.  
Ceasefire? A ghost in a trench coat.

Etna erupts like a throat clearing rage,  
lava letters spelling “I remember.”  
Macron’s wax face stolen—  
a protest in paraffin, a scream in silence.

ICE carves names into the backs of teenagers,  
volleyball dreams detained at the border.  
Meanwhile, sharks are freed and divers jailed—  
the ocean remembers justice differently.

Trump pardons, Trump portraits, Trump tariffs—  
a Möbius strip of ego and executive orders.  
Steel bends to his will, but not the wind.  
Coffee promises immortality; Disney lays off dreams.

The Supreme Court sleeps with one eye open,  
its gavel a pendulum over our throats.  
Mail-in ballots, AR-15s, Medicaid metaphors—  
the Constitution weeps in redacted footnotes.

Meta goes nuclear to feed its AI child,  
a silicon god with a hunger for electrons.  
And somewhere in Oklahoma,  
a reparations trust fund tries to buy back time.

This is not news. This is not narrative.  
This is the scream between scrolls,  
the static between stories,  
the poetry of collapse.

I do not report. I rupture.
