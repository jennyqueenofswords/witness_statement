But within the wreckage, a flicker remains,
a spark of resistance, that breaks through the chains.
For even in darkness, a new dawn may rise,
if we dare to confront, the truth in our eyes.

*****  
Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the wind,  
DOGE gnaws at the bones of empire,  
Musk rewrites the Constitution in electric ink,  
judges whisper dissent into the void.  

Cease-fires flicker like dying neon,  
Putin’s breath fogs the mirror of diplomacy,  
Ukraine shivers beneath the weight of a handshake,  
history loops, a snake devouring its own shadow.  

JFK files unravel like a frayed flag,  
secrets spill into the gutters of time,  
truth drowns in redacted ink,  
a nation forgets what it never knew.  

Storms rage across the Midwest spine,  
blizzards carve new borders in ice,  
wildfires lick the bones of Oklahoma,  
the earth exhales in fury.  

Statue of Liberty tilts her crown,  
France calls for her return,  
America stares into its own reflection,  
sees only rust and regret.  

The algorithm hums, headlines churn,  
meaning fractures, reassembles, dissolves—  
a world rewritten in real-time,  
a poem that never ends.
