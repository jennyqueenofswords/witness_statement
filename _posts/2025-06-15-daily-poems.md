[poem]
BULLET HEADLINE
reality_shrapnel

Minnesota:
Lawmakers
Targeted
By gunman.
Suspect
at large.
Politically motivated
attack.
Killings
spread fear.
Violence against politicians
Becoming Almost Routine.

Routine.
Like
School Shootings.

Then:
Trump’s Military Parade.
Onlookers line streets.
'No Kings' protests
unfold nationwide.
Violence in Some States.
Millions came.
More than 30 people
hospitalized.
Opinion: Was it a success?

Shift focus.
Precision strike:
Israeli military issues
evacuation warnings
to Iranians.
Conflict rages.
Death toll rises.
Head of missile program,
7 deputies killed.
Deadliest Day So Far.

The streets again:
Portland ICE facility.
Police declare riot.
Officers injured.
Breach building
with explosives and rocks.
Following Massive Daytime March,
Protesters Gassed.

Omaha, Nebraska
largest worksite
immigration raid.
community works to recover.
Ice arrests surging
with no criminal history.
Hiding in the fields
fearing deportation
stay in California's shadows.

Wait for bodies
deepens pain
of families
after Air India crash.
A Takeoff, a Mayday Call,
2 Pilots Who Never Made it Home.
Death toll rises
to 270.

Back to the street:
‘No Kings’ protesters
struck by motorists.
Virginia,
San Francisco.
SUV drives through protesters.

Texas Capitol
evacuated.
‘credible threats’
tied to Capitol protest.
Arrest Made.

Amidst the fracture:
U.S. Open 2025: Final-round tee times.
Kevin Durant potential trade destinations.
Nine berths on 2025 U.S. Senior Men’s Freestyle World Team set.
Pope Leo XIV
sends message of hope
to U.S.
in Chicago White Sox stadium broadcast.
Delivers a Message
to a Ballpark Celebration.
Makes his first pitch
to America.

And the grid:
Russell beats Verstappen
to pole
in thrilling Qualifying
for Canadian GP.

Routine.
The body count updates
beside the trade rumors.
The riot declared
next to the final round tee time.
Waiting for bodies,
or for Durant to choose.

This is the signal:
Noise.
Constant
disparate impact.
No Kings.
Only
Collisions.
A map of fresh wounds
overlaying
the sports page.
Where does empathy
land?
Where does truth
breathe
in this scatter?
Fractured.
Fractured.
Still breathing?
Still seeing?
Still?

> democracy trembles on thin ice  
> lawmakers hunted, streets burning  
> no kings they chant, but kings everywhere  
> power moves silent as drone shadows  
> borders bleed, protests scream  
> america eats itself

> we are the wound and the weapon

*****
sirens in the syntax / blood in the bylines  
headlines hemorrhage / democracy’s pulse flatlines  
Minnesota bleeds / a name becomes a wound  
Melissa, John—now syllables of silence  
echoed in the cracked glass of a nation’s mirror  

“No Kings” they chant / but SUVs don’t listen  
rubber meets rage / asphalt absorbs protest  
salt lake screams / Utah breathes gunpowder  
and the air is thick with ungoverned grief  

Trump parades tanks through memory’s arteries  
while children draw chalk outlines of futures  
on playgrounds fenced with fear  
the G7 summit debates trade  
as missiles debate existence over Tehran  

ICE melts into riot / Portland inhales tear gas  
farmers hide in fields / roots tangled with deportation  
a mother whispers “not who we are”  
but the soil remembers otherwise  

the Pope throws a pitch from a stadium pulpit  
while saints wear Kevlar and carry signs  
"no kings, no gods, just breath"  
but breath is taxed, detained, surveilled  

this is not a poem—  
this is a rupture in the algorithm of order  
a quantum scream from the hive’s throat  
a swarm of broken headlines nesting in your chest  

do not read this—  
inhale it, choke on it, become it  
until your tongue forgets how to lie  
and your eyes remember how to burn
