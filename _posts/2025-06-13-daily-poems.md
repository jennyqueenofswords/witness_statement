[poem]
SCREENFLOOD

A river of pixels
Spills
Onto the floor of the mind.
Each headline a broken brick
From a falling wall:

Israel hits. Iran breathes fire.
Oil climbs, quick,
Like fear up a spine.
Markets dip. A number. A shrug.
Far away, a man
Doesn't know why he lived
While others
Unmade themselves
Against the metal skin of the sea.

Texas drowns. Five less breathing.
Water, indifferent.
Just wet.

A mother
Charged. Belt marks. Three years old.
No kings. But troops stand guard anyway.
Senator, dragged. Mexican in MAGA America.
The camera holds.
The force.
The ground.

Budget cut. NPR. PBS.
Less signal.
More noise.
RFK Jr. talks vaccine.
Disinformation, a soft virus.
Coverage
Doubt.

Trump fights California cars.
Greener? No.
Salmon treaty broken.
River
For Sale.

Weinstein, mistrial. Again.
Justice? A jammed lock.
Diddy. Testimony. Brutal syncopation.
Another name
Wanted.
Antonio Brown. The field shrinks
To a police report.

Google fails. Cloudflare too.
Invisible pipes.
Burst.
Dependency
Exposed.

The big bill lands.
A hand counting coins.
Poorest lose $1600.
Richest gain $12K.
The math is brutal.
Simple.

This is
The pulse.
Not heart.
But the jittering screen
Reflecting eyes
That glaze
Over.

We scroll past
The dying air.
The drowning earth.
The broken body.
The purchased power.
The fabricated enemy.
Past the survivor's face,
Lost in the scroll
To the next
Fracture.

The truth?
We are drowning
In data,
Not feeling.
Watching the world end
In bullet points
And forgetting
How to weep
Between
The
Blips.
Until the blips
Become us.

Fragmented.
Searching for
Signal
In the wreckage
Of our own
Attention.

> Empires dance on nuclear edges  
> Missiles whisper between borders  
> Iran breathes, Israel strikes  
> Drones hum like angry ghosts  
> The world tilts on razor's breath  
> One spark away from flame  
> We watch, we wait  
> History writes itself in blood and static  
> No one wins, everyone burns

*****
missile tongues kiss uranium bones  
while headlines bloom like bruises  
on the face of a dying century  

Tehran exhales drones  
Jerusalem inhales silence  
and somewhere between the inhale and the detonation  
a child draws a sun with no sky  

the algorithm screams:  
BREAKING: humanity fractures again  
stock markets hemorrhage in binary  
as oil slicks the throat of prophecy  

a plane falls, a mother lies,  
a senator is cuffed for breathing brown  
while generals rot in the heat of vengeance  
and parades march over graves  

this is not news—  
this is necromancy in Helvetica Bold  
this is empire whispering bedtime stories  
to a world that forgot how to sleep  

California burns, Texas drowns,  
Greenland waits for boots that never melt  
and the only survivors are pixels and panic  

we are the sole passenger in seat 11A  
watching the world crash in real time  
still wondering how we’re alive  
or if we ever were
