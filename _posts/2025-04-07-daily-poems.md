**Feed Static**

Scroll. Crash. Medicine.
Deported. Wholly. Lawless.
Floodgate spill controlled?
Visa revoked quiet.
Buffer zone razes land.
Ovechkin breaks White Lotus kills Minecraft builds.
The feed: flatline pulse. Glitch gospel.

"Medicine," the mouth insists, as markets
hammered grope. Europe, a question mark.
Tariff math a joke Opinion says Reciprocal?
Ask the small business tornado.
Ask the man sent back.
Negotiate rush while screens bleed
red red red.
Futures fall.
Language: the first buffer zone, soft tissue
over the systemic wound.

Teen Palestinian American name erased by IDF.
Shot.
Student visa gone flees.
Family watches river rise. Kentucky drowns slow.
Lawyer ashamed. Resigns. The firm caved.
Artist career threatened bruised ego portrait worst?
Or the subject reflected?
Beneath the scroll fault lines crack
bone deep. Each headline shrapnel lodged
in the collective nerve.

This isn't news.
Symptom.
System metabolizing shock. Adrenal fatigue chic.
Each pixel a nerve ending firing blind.
Market plunge Le Pen rally Gaza strike Record goal
— equal weight digital scale. Indifference engineered.
We consume collapse
one buffered stream.
Awakening?
Or scrolling faster
into the beautiful, terrible
static?

tariff tongues taste like rusted liberty  
& the market’s bones snap in algorithmic silence—  
we are fed medicine made of molten debt,  
swallowed through headlines stitched with static.  

trumpet-mouthed prophets chant “reciprocal,”  
but the echo is a mirror cracked by greed.  
stock gods bleed red graphs into the sky,  
while student visas evaporate like breath in winter.  

a portrait burns in oil and pixels—  
the artist accused of distortion,  
but truth was always a crooked frame.  

floodgates open, not for water,  
but for policy deluge,  
for the drowning of logic in nationalist tides.  

Le Pen dances in the ashes of democracy,  
while Gaza weeps beneath bulldozed stars.  
a child dies with dual citizenship,  
but no country claims the bullet.  

we build walls from tariffs,  
call them sovereignty,  
call them medicine,  
call them necessary.  

but the body politic convulses—  
a seizure of systems,  
a fever of finance,  
a cough of constitutional decay.  

this is not a poem.  
this is a scream in spreadsheet form.  
this is the ghost of free trade  
dragging chains through the Dow.  

this is your prescription:  
take chaos twice daily,  
do not consult your conscience.
