**Feed//Fracture**

Screen bleeds light. Headlines detonate.
*Trump signs.* Ink dries. Airwaves choke. *NPR PBS gone.*
White House (.gov) declares *BIASED MEDIA SUBSIDIZATION ENDED.*
Clean cut. Like funding. Like truth.

Signal flash. *Waltz photographed.* Day before removal.
Orbit shifts. *Rubio ascends.* Another role. Portfolio fat.
While Sistine chimney waits. *Papal election.* Smoke signals ancient code.
Drone signals new. *Gaza aid ship attacked.* SOS pulses under Malta waves.

*Dolls.* Miller smiles. *Willing to pay more.* Two instead of thirty.
Plastic patriotism. Tariff teeth bite small hands.
Same breath: *Budget Seeks 23% Domestic Cut.*
Libraries shiver. Parks wither. Meals thin.
While *13% Defense Hike.* Steel blooms. Budgets bleed different colors.

*Stock trade ban.* Bipartisan maybe. *PELOSI Act.* Hawley pushes.
Irony ticker: Trump supports.
While *China evaluates.* Trade talks conditional. Futures twitch.
Market breath held. Global lung.

*May Day.* Protest shouts swallowed by the scroll.
*Alien Enemies Act.* Judge bars. South Texas sighs. For now.
Deportation engine idles. *Speed a hallmark.* Ghost towns forming.
*Gaza kitchens warn.* Empty pots echo blockade. *Bodies breaking.* Minds too.
WHO cries out. Sound muffled by the next *Full Coverage.*

*REAL ID.* Deadline looms. Fly or stay grounded.
Paper walls rise.
*AfD extremist.* German label sticks. Or tries to.
*Bernie in Philly.* Resistance tours. 70 arrested. Highway blocked.
Veins of the city clogged. Like arteries of state.

*California emissions blocked.* Gas cars breathe easier. Lungs fill with past.
*Transgender care questioned.* 400 pages. Who wrote it? *HHS won’t say.*
Bodies debated. Futures erased by redacted authors.
*Kilmar Ábrego García.* Protective orders surface. *Wife beater.* DHS says.
Deported anyway. Mistake acknowledged. Man still gone.

Scroll faster.
*Ukraine minerals.* Zelenskyy lures. US signs. Access granted.
Earth’s veins tapped. For power. For profit.
*Georgia Democrats plummet.* Base demands fight.
*Trump renames Veterans Day.* Victory Day. WWI. History rewritten live.
*Tariffs hit.* $900 million Apple cost. Temu abandons. *Cue the chaos.*

This isn't news.
It's shrapnel.
Lodged behind the eyes.
Each fragment sharp, contradictory, demanding.
*Full Coverage* promises depth, delivers deluge.
Numb thumb swipes. Synapse fires dull sparks.

The feed, a surgical instrument carving indifference.
Or is it?
Look closer.
Between the lines, the white space screams.
The fracture itself, the message.
This broken mirror shows *us*.
Awake. The anesthetic is wearing off.
Feel the cut.

i.

they cut the tongues from the radios,  
fed static to the children.  
NPR, PBS—alphabet bones  
crushed beneath executive teeth.  
the signal bleeds Morse code:  
—.- ..- .. . -  
quiet, quiet, quiet.

ii.

dolls made in America now cost  
the price of a scream.  
two instead of thirty,  
Stephen Miller whispers  
into the ear of a plastic child  
with no eyelids.

iii.

a chimney rises in Rome—  
not for smoke, but surveillance.  
Cardinals sip espresso,  
gamble on God’s next avatar.  
meanwhile, Gaza starves  
on a sea of drones and broken bread.

iv.

Rubio ascends like a helium balloon  
tied to a budget cut.  
Trump’s parade stomps through D.C.,  
6,600 soldiers marching in iambic pentameter,  
each boot a syllable of empire.

v.

the Pope is not dead,  
but the conclave begins anyway.  
a new religion forms:  
capitalism with communion wafers  
shaped like tariffs.

vi.

they rename Veterans Day—  
Victory Day for World War I.  
as if history were a dog to be renamed,  
as if memory could be redacted  
with a gold Sharpie and a smirk.

vii.

in the Missouri River, three girls float—  
not metaphors, not headlines,  
just silence that no executive order can erase.  
America hums a lullaby in Morse:  
.- .-.. .-.. / .. ... / .-.. --- ... -  

all is lost.

viii.

but still: protesters pitch tents,  
students chant beneath drone-sky.  
language breaks open like a piñata—  
truth spills out in candy-colored shards.  

we eat what we can.  

we write what they fear.
