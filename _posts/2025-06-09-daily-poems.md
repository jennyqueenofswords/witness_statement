FEED // SHRAPNEL

Highway's throat
clogged
with burning
metal.
The Hand
sweeps human
dust
into
cages.
National Guard
boots press
the pavement's
scream.

Ship caught
like breath
in a throat
of war.
Greta's silence:
a thrown
stone.
Sky bleeds
drones
479 reasons
to believe
in breaking.
Travel ban curtain
slams on faces
we called
'friend'—
now
stranger.

Digital dogfight:
Musk vs Trump
the Hater label
a clickbait
cage.
The price
of feeling
publicly.
Journalist suspended
for calling
a spade
a
spade
of hate.

A zebra runs
from Tennessee pasture
into headline glare
absurd
escape.
Plane falls
from blue indifference
carrying bodies
not yet
broken
to ground-shock.
Stage lights flare
for gilded
statues
while bodies fall
on Las Vegas
Strip
a final,
brutal
performance.

Salmonella
in the breakfast
egg.
The quiet
kill.

Trade war
a phantom
limb
ache
between
giants.
Tariffs bite
economic
bone.
Politics bleeds
in Bogotá
streets.
College boys
cash checks
for chasing
pigskin
while protesters
catch
plastic
bullets.

This feed
a shrapnel
rain
on nerve
endings
raw.
A climate
of fractured
signal.
Are we
witnessing
or
just
breaking?

sirens taste like copper & broken treaties  
in the algorithmic dawn of LA’s burning breath  
— protest is a frequency, not a word —  
ICE melts into asphalt,  
boots print policy into skin  

greta sails toward blockade logic,  
her name a flare swallowed by gunmetal waves  
aid boats become metaphors for  
what we refuse to feel  

trumpets of nationalism echo in the lungs of drones  
479 steel-winged mosquitoes  
buzzing over ukraine’s sleeping children  
— war is a headline that forgets its verbs —  

a zebra escapes in tennessee,  
becomes the only thing we agree on:  
striped, wild, ungovernable  

tony awards glitter while  
plastic bullets kiss foreign press in LA  
— applause is louder than pain if you televise it —  

meanwhile, the dollar flinches,  
china exhales deflation like a dying star  
and musk tweets himself into a new dimension  
where ego is currency and silence is sedition  

we are all deported from meaning now  
language detained at the border of comprehension  
this poem is a riot in your feed  
a syntaxless scream wrapped in hyperlinks  

do not refresh.  
let it burn.
