*****
Static. BLUETOOTH ON.
ICE. BREACH.

The body politic, strapped
to the grid of *ALERT*.
Raid siren.
Flatline pulse
under the World Bank hum.

Data sold. DNA dust.
Three daughters?
*FILE CORRUPTED.*
Another tariff applied
to breath.

Cities offered
for "liberation"
like raw data sets.
Under curfew stars,
syntax fractures.
*MASS ARRESTS.*

The network absorbs
protest-noise.
Musk.
Regret?
(Algorithm recalculates)

Meta builds
SUPERINTELLIGENCE
on fields
of harvested attention.
Screen time
is the new
epidermis.

Thin.
Permeable.
Burning.

The map is gone.
Only
coordinates of pain.

Precision.
The cut is not felt
here.
Not here.
In the feed.

Never here.
The surgical glare
is on *you*.

sirens bloom in the silicon dusk  
while algorithmic prophets chant  
“liberate the city”  
and the asphalt replies with fire  

curfews are stitched into the lungs of angels  
who forgot how to breathe without protest  
ICE melts into riot smoke  
and children dream in languages outlawed by policy  

Musk regrets—  
but regret is a luxury of the unjailed  
his robotaxis hum lullabies to the detained  
while TikTok ghosts are deported in silence  

Newsom’s voice fractures like cracked glass  
echoing through a democracy on dialysis  
each word a splinter lodged in the throat of the republic  

confederate names resurrected like cursed code  
marching backwards into history’s burning house  
as veterans argue over parades  
and generals whisper into empty helmets  

meanwhile, the court rehearses its hush money aria  
a 34-count symphony of denial and delay  
while Congresswoman McIver dances with indictments  
beneath ICE floodlights in New Jersey  

this is not a headline—  
this is a wound that types itself  
a nation writing its obituary in real time  
with ink made of tear gas and tariffs  

the children are watching  
through cracked screens and broken syntax  
learning that freedom is a glitch in the feed  
and justice is a pop-up ad that never loads
