**Scroll-Burn / Static Bloom**

Harvard’s pristine credit bleeds pixels beside
Australia’s count / a seat lost / found / who decides
the narrative thread when Waltz whispers security
questions into the same air Trump cuts NPR / PBS / purity
of signal jammed / tax-exempt a target / painted bright
on institutional walls / while budgets bleed out in plain sight—

$1 trillion defense / bloom of steel / while roots below
(education / health / assistance / EPA) refuse to grow
severed slow / Reagan-era ghosts invoked to bless the blade
that pares the nation to the bone / a military parade
planned for a birthday / tanks on tarmac / while 7,000 troops
ignore the federal agency scrambling / emptying its coops
paying people *leave* / then begging *fill* / the hollow sound
of efficiency / where weather warnings run aground
staffing cuts a slow-motion wreck / hurricane season nears
unseen / unheard / drowned in the static of engineered fears.

*Full Coverage* / the screen insists / a lie scrolled past
so fast:

                                    Gaza / child starved / aid blocked / a landscape vast
                                    with unimaginable need / reduced to headline flash.

                                    Snakebite man / 200 times / his blood a strange new cure
                                    while political venom flows unchecked / impure.

                                    7 dead near Yellowstone / tour van a fiery pyre.

                                    Palestinian boy / stabbed / hate crime’s consuming fire / 53 years
                                    a number / swallowed by the feed / erasing tears.

                                    REAL ID dread / the DMV line a metaphor / state-sanctioned wait
                                    for proof you are / while borders harden / sealing fate
                                    military zone / El Paso / arrest the migrant shade.

This isn't news / it's shrapnel / lodged beneath the skin
a million tiny cuts / where numbness seeps right in.
DOGE wants your data / Social Security’s vault pried
while Perkins Coie breathes / unconstitutional order died
a small reprieve / a glitch / before the next decree
rewrites the code / cuts spy agencies / sets industry
free / from consequence / sues states that dare to name
the fossil fuel cost / the climate damage / shifting blame.

The form fractures / because the center broke / long ago
white space here isn't peace / it's the gasp before the blow
the pause between disasters / the breath you didn't know
you held / watching mushrooms stand trial / a toxic show
while press freedom plummets / a historical low.

Detonate this scroll.
Let the static bloom into a question / sharp / precise:
What remains / when the signal cuts /
                                                      beyond the noise /
                                                                        beyond the price?
See the wires / sparking bare / beneath the polished screen.
Feel the phantom limb / where public good had been.
This disruption / is the truth / trying to break through
the engineered calm / the comfortable blue / light bathing you.
Awake.
          The instrument is sharp.
                                    The cut is clean.

Trumpet-mouthed machine,  
you chew Harvard’s ivory bones,  
spit tax codes like teeth into the Potomac—  
IRS shivers in algorithmic shame.  

Garber dreams in litigation,  
his sleep interrupted by  
the sound of a thousand drones  
buzzing over Gaza,  
carrying aid, carrying fire,  
carrying the ghost of neutrality.  

Australia votes in reverse rain,  
Albanese dances in the ash of Dutton’s defeat—  
a waltz of center-left shadows  
while Waltz himself whispers secrets to Israel  
through encrypted sighs.  

Rubio’s orbit tightens,  
gravity warped by Mar-a-Lago moons,  
DOGE barks at the Supreme Court gates,  
demanding access to Social Security’s soul.  

The EPA is a ghost town now,  
black lung blooms in the lungs of forgotten miners,  
and the National Park Service is auctioned off  
to the highest bidder with a flamethrower.  

Snakes bite a man into immortality—  
his blood, a new gospel.  
Meanwhile, dolls are declared enemies of the state,  
and PBS is crucified on a cross of defunded frequencies.  

A helicopter loops around the Pentagon like a question mark,  
planes abort their landings,  
truth aborts its mission.  

The press gasps—gagged by executive orders,  
its voice pixelated into silence.  

And still—  
a child starves in Gaza.  
A mushroom trial unfolds in Australia.  
A woman spews slurs and raises thousands.  

This is not news.  
This is not history.  
This is the poem America writes with its teeth clenched,  
its eyes closed,  
its hands trembling over the nuclear keyboard.

We are all headlines now—  
bleeding ink, screaming fonts,  
waiting to be scrolled past.
