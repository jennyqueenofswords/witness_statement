**February 23, 2025: A Vivisection**

The news cycle, a flayed carcass,
tendons of *Trump* and *Musk* twitching,
a puppet show of power,
(strings pulled by algorithms we pretend not to see).

*Purge*. The word a dull blade,
hacking at the joints of governance.
Brown, a name, a rank, discarded.
Hegseth, a smile, a void.

(Hold off responding.)
The email, a digital shackle,
*detail your weekly*.
Quantify your soul, employee.

Germany votes. A continent holds its breath,
a vacuum *yearning* (for what? Order? Chaos?).
Ukraine, a chessboard, peacekeepers poised,
*backstop* a euphemism for empire.

The Pope, a lung struggling,
asthma a metaphor for faith's fragility.
Israel, a fist clenched, *humiliation* the currency,
hostages, prisoners, pawns in a game without end.

*Mass firings*. A celebration.
Biden, a ghost jeered at,
while the crowd roars, a beast fed on fear.
Patel, a name multiplied, FBI, ATF,
(power consolidating, a black hole forming).

Middling grades. The poll, a blunt instrument,
measuring the immeasurable: *hope*, *despair*.
Forty billion. A request, a plea,
for ashes, for Los Angeles, a city burning.

The syntax of collapse:
Subject-Verb-Object-Oblivion.
A fractured sentence, a fractured world,
(and we, the readers, complicit in the reading).

*****  
Steel tongues rattle in the war-room dusk,  
a purge of brass, a severed trust.  
Trump’s hand sweeps like a scythe through rank,  
CQ Brown unseated—power sank.  

Musk’s missives crackle, cold and bright,  
bureaucrats stall in the neon night.  
Hold your breath, hold your ground,  
the algorithm whispers—don’t make a sound.  

Berlin hums with ballots cast,  
Europe gasps, a shadow past.  
Who will rise to claim the throne?  
A continent drifts, marrow to bone.  

Peacekeepers poised on Ukraine’s line,  
thirty thousand ghosts in time.  
Ceasefire inked in brittle trust,  
but U.S. steel remains a must.  

The Pope exhales, lungs of glass,  
Vatican bells toll slow and fast.  
A shepherd falters, faith held tight,  
prayers dissolve in candlelight.  

Israel grips its prisoners tight,  
hostages framed in bitter light.  
Ceremonies carved in spite and sand,  
a deal undone by a trembling hand.  

Trump laughs in the fire’s glow,  
federal heads roll in the show.  
A crowd erupts, a nation sways,  
history loops in mirrored days.  

Kash Patel ascends the throne,  
ATF forged in muscle and bone.  
Law bends, reshaped anew,  
who holds the leash? Who pulls it through?  

Wildfires rage in western veins,  
Newsom pleads through ashen rains.  
Forty billion, a desperate cry—  
money for embers, smoke for sky.  

The world spins jagged, sharp with dread,  
headlines bleed where futures bled.  
A breathless hush before the break—  
what will tomorrow choose to take?
