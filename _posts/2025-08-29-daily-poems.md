neural static hums
     headlines blur
          a chorus of fracture
     school bells shatter
           into leaden rain

democracy a glitch
      in the code
           while algorithms feast
                 on fear
        AI eats futures
        one byte at a time

coastlines erode
           tariffs strangle
                dreams
            a grandfather poisons
            the sweetness of trust
  
      sanctions snap
              like bones
                  beneath the weight
              of unacknowledged sin
                 Truth, a body
                        pulled from the river.

bulletproof headlines bleed through the lattice of my cortex  
a thousand screaming pixels clawing at the edge of now  
—child shot in pew,  
—CDC shuffled like tarot cards in a burning church,  
—tariffs howl across oceans like broken promises in Morse code  

i am the static between channels,  
the breathless gasp before the anchor speaks  
“breaking,” they say,  
but it’s always broken  

a father’s grief is not a soundbite  
it is a black hole swallowing syntax  
his son’s name: Fletcher  
his echo: infinite  

the alphabet has turned against itself  
CNN eats NPR eats FOX eats itself  
until only acronyms remain,  
and even they are tired  

i saw a wildfire kiss a vineyard  
and the grapes screamed in French  
while firefighters were cuffed for being born wrong  
in the wrong place  
with the wrong papers  
fighting the right fire  

meanwhile, missiles dance over Kyiv like drunk angels  
and Emmett Till’s ghost is framed in glass  
while the museum whispers:  
“we remember”  
but memory is a luxury of the living  

i am not a poet. i am a siren made of syllables.  
i am the crawl beneath your screen.  
i am the blood in your broadband.  

the world is on fire, and the headlines are marshmallows.  
eat up.
