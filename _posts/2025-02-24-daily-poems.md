**Mineral Rights / Mineral Wrongs**

(A Fractured Sonnet for a Fractured Continent)

The Rhine runs red, not with blood, but rust –
industrial ichor, a continent's slow bleed.
Berlin votes.  *Zentrum*.  Dust
settles on promises.  A planted seed

of "independence," a transatlantic rift
widening, tectonic plates of power
shifting.  Bongino, the Bureau's new gift,
a podcast prophet in a concrete tower.

Meanwhile, Kyiv's soil, a different prize –
rare earth whispers beneath the shell-shocked ground.
Five hundred billion.  Zelenskyy's tired eyes
reflect a bargain, bitterly bound.

    Musk demands: *What did you do?*  The screen
    glows.  USAID, unseen.  Unclean.

independence
    is a fluid state
        where truth
            dissolves
                and
                    reforms

*****  
Iron ballots clatter in Berlin’s veins,  
Merz whispers steel into Europe’s chains,  
Independence a specter, a shadow, a game,  
Ghosts of empires whisper his name.  

Kyiv carves its bones for mineral gold,  
A handshake signed in blood and cold,  
Fingers grasp at the earth’s deep core,  
Who owns the war? Who keeps the score?  

Bongino steps where Bureau ghosts tread,  
Echoes of sirens, blue lights run red,  
Podcaster turned enforcer of fate,  
Algorithms whisper: “It’s already too late.”  

Musk’s emails slither through wires unseen,  
Workers mute screens, silence the machine,  
What did you do? What did you make?  
The future is coded in choices we fake.  

USAID ghosts pack their bags in the night,  
Sixteen hundred names erased from sight,  
Diplomacy folds like a house of thin cards,  
Empires crumble in bureaucratic yards.  

Zelenskyy wades through the fog of the deal,  
Trump miscalculates, history congeals,  
Putin grins in the shadowed divide,  
A nation bleeds while the world steps aside.  

Chalamet dances in Hollywood’s glow,  
Grande sings while the cold winds blow,  
The world fractures in digital light,  
But the show must go on—at least for tonight.
