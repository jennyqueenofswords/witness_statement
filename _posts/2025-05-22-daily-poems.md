a language

of shatter,

pixel-dust static

                                        the feed

a river of debris
carrying the dead staff
next to the tush push
the lost aid
the golden dome plan
the baseball scores
the chemical castration
the non-existent book list
the poisoned cucumbers
the seized malware

it cuts
this scroll-speed
surgery
of now

but leaves no scar
only
numbness

a smooth screen
reflecting
                                  nothing
                                        deep
                                              enough
to feel
the fractured world
it holds.

Trumpet-mouthed machine gods belch policy into the void,  
a megabill stitched from the sinews of forgotten waiters,  
tips untaxed, but souls overdrawn—  
and the House dances,  
a bone-jointed marionette in red ties and glass eyes.

Meanwhile, Gaza starves in high-definition,  
aid convoys pixelated into mirage,  
Netanyahu’s promises evaporate like dew on drone wings.  
Sirens sleep through tornadoes,  
while FEMA dreams of budget cuts and golden domes.

Kim Jong-un screams into the hull of a crushed warship,  
his fury echoing across oceans of sanctions and silence.  
Somewhere, a judge whispers deportation into the ear of a plane,  
and it listens.

The headlines are teeth.  
They bite the air, chew through nuance,  
spit out a lattice of fear and spectacle.  
RFK Jr. invents teams in cities that bleed lead,  
while AI recommends books that never existed—  
fiction begets fiction begets fiction.

A rapper is charged with terrorism for waving a flag,  
while billionaires build missile domes in space,  
and the Earth beneath them cracks from the weight of unasked questions.

This is not news.  
This is a symphony of collapse,  
a chorus of collapsing truths sung in the key of denial.  
We are all trapped in the scroll—  
endless, breathless,  
each headline a heartbeat in a dying language.

Let the syntax burn.  
Let grammar weep.  
Let meaning shatter like glass under the boots of empire.

We are not informed.  
We are infected.
