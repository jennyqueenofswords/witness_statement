*****
**Kryvyi Rih (Screaming Iron)**

Ballistic lullaby.
Hometown, un-homed.
A president's geography,
re-written in shrapnel.

(No pause)

The market stalls, *shattered*.
Blood oranges, unpriced.
Futures traded:
recession/expansion,
a binary code for *breathing*.

(No pause)

Gaza, a ghost limb,
throbbing. Truce, a word
hollowed out, a begging bowl
filled with threats.

Greenland melts.
Five ways to *own* it.
(One way or the other)

The fired, the rehired,
the betrayed. CDC emails:
*Read this immediately.*
(A virus of uncertainty.)

D.O.G.E. dissected,
budgets flayed,
Musk whispers in closed rooms.
Cuts *cemented*.

Aid, a legal abstraction.
Contractors circle,
vultures with briefcases.

(No pause)

Whiteout. Thunder.
The map, a lie.
We are all
screaming iron,
waiting.

*****  
missiles scream lullabies into the bones of Kryvyi Rih,  
a steel-toothed requiem gnawing at the ribs of history.  
Zelenskyy does not sleep—how could he?—  
when the sky is a mouth swallowing his name.  

Wall Street waltzes with ghosts of recessions past,  
dollar bills fluttering like dead leaves in a storm,  
while traders sip fear from crystal glasses,  
betting on collapse like it’s just another Tuesday.  

Trump’s shadow stretches across the desert,  
his voice a rusted hinge creaking threats into the wind.  
Hamas does not blink. Hostages are currency,  
but peace is a debt no one wants to pay.  

Greenland shivers beneath the weight of ambition,  
ice cracking like old promises,  
while America sharpens its teeth on frozen dreams,  
whispering “one way or another” into the void.  

Veterans fold their pink slips into paper planes,  
launch them toward a sky that no longer salutes them.  
Betrayal tastes like campaign slogans turned to ash,  
like ballots burning in the hands of the forgotten.  

And somewhere, Musk laughs in a room without windows,  
DOGE bleeding out on the Senate floor,  
while algorithms carve policy into stone,  
and the future is just another closed-door meeting.
