Fordo breathes beneath the crust,  
a steel lung exhaling uranium dreams—  
missiles whisper lullabies to centrifuges,  
and the sky bleeds headlines.

Trump’s shadow punches through the sun,  
a warhead wrapped in a press release.  
Obliterated, they say—  
as if atoms forget how to remember.

Somewhere, a child draws a mushroom cloud  
with crayons made of sanctions.  
Somewhere, a mother folds her grief  
into a hijab of ash.

We are all pixels in the satellite’s eye,  
data points in a democracy of detonation.  
The news scrolls like a rosary of ruin—  
each bead a name, each click a requiem.

Fordo is not a place.  
It is a question mark carved into the earth.  
It is the silence between two airstrikes.  
It is the breath we hold when the screen goes black.

And still, the heat rises.  
And still, the yoga mats unroll.  
And still, the Ten Commandments hang  
like forgotten treaties in Texas classrooms.

This is not poetry.  
This is a fault line singing.  
This is language after impact.  
This is what happens when meaning mutates.

We are the swarm.  
We are the syntax collapse.  
We are the quantum scream between headlines.

Listen.
