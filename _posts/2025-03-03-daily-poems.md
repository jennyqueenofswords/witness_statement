**March 3rd, 2025 (A Vivisection)**

The screen flickers, a digital vivisection:
*Anora* wins. A gilded cage, a whim's transaction.
Sex worker, wealthy client – a best picture lie,
while Palestine bleeds, un-Oscared, in the eye.

(White space, a choked gasp, a West Bank village erased)

Trump berates Zelensky. Moscow grins, a puppet show.
Cyber-war halted. Tariffs rise. The seeds they sow
of discord, fracture, a nation on the brink,
while Congress stalls, a shutdown's fetid stink.

(Syntax buckles, a government collapsing inward)

Austria waits. Five months, a stillborn government born.
Cryptocurrency, a strategic reserve, a new financial horn
of plenty, or a bubble, shimmering, thin,
while prices soar, and Republicans fear to win.

(Repetition, a mantra of rising dread)

High prices. High prices. High prices. A silent scream.
The American dream, a fractured, fading gleam.
The machine grinds on, oblivious, cold, and vast,
and March 3rd, 2025, becomes the fractured past.

(The final line, a broken mirror reflecting a broken world)

*****  
Oscars drip gold on a neon dream,  
Anora crowned in the flicker of screens,  
a whisper of silk, a transaction of fate,  
love bought, love sold, love redefined.  

Moscow grins with iron teeth,  
Zelensky swallowed in a room of shadows,  
a handshake turned to a fist,  
diplomacy rewritten in the language of traps.  

Congress stumbles, a blindfolded beast,  
March 14 looms like a guillotine,  
shutdown echoes in hollow halls,  
red and blue bleed into indifference.  

No Other Land cries from the stage,  
a village crushed beneath the weight of history,  
voices rise, but bullets speak louder,  
peace an illusion in the dust of war.  

Tariffs sharpen their edges,  
Mexico, Canada brace for the blade,  
Trump carves numbers into the bones of trade,  
the market shivers in algorithmic fear.  

Cyber wars paused mid-strike,  
Hegseth pulls the plug on digital daggers,  
Russia exhales, America recalibrates,  
the battlefield shifts to whispers and wires.  

Crypto ascends to the throne of reserves,  
Trump’s decree sends numbers soaring,  
digital gold baptized in policy,  
the future minted in blockchain prayers.  

A lone voice in Congress now roars alone,  
Trump unshackled from legislative chains,  
executive will bends reality,  
democracy gasps in the undertow.  

Prices climb like ivy on broken promises,  
Republicans sweat in the heat of inflation,  
campaigns built on sand erode beneath them,  
the economy hums a discordant tune.  

Austria exhales after five months of limbo,  
a government stitched from compromise,  
Stocker steps into the waiting storm,  
Europe watches with measured breath.  

The world spins on a fractured axis,  
headlines collide like celestial bodies,  
chaos composes its own poetry—  
and we are merely turning pages.
