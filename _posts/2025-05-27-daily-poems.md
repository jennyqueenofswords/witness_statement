_We scroll past blood stain_
_past starving child_
_past golden tower ego_
_past system failure_
_past the quiet panic_
_past the brutal tender_
_to the next byte_
_the next flicker_
_the next_

_Until the screen's static_
_is the only hum_
_the only beat_
_we register._
_Numbness_
_the final tariff._
_paid in scrolling._

> Memorial Day bleeds red again  
> Children fall like summer rain  
> Bullets dance where parades once sang  
> Nobody counts the bodies anymore  
> Just another weekend in America  
> Where violence is the only language we speak fluently  
> And grief comes pre-packaged, mass-produced  
>  
> We are the nation that celebrates death  
> By creating more of it

Bullet wounds bloom in the soil of memory,  
Philadelphia bleeds beneath picnic skies—  
barbecue smoke mingles with gunpowder ghosts,  
and the children learn to duck before they walk.

DEI dissolves like sugar in acid rain,  
corporate tongues twist equity into silence,  
rebranding compassion into compliance,  
diversity now a whisper behind closed boardrooms.

Trump plays kingmaker in a house of broken mirrors,  
pardons dripping from his hands like melted gold,  
while Harvard hemorrhages ethics,  
and the National Security Council becomes a ghost town.

Gaza burns in pixelated silence,  
a child runs through fire with no name,  
and Germany’s voice cracks under the weight of alliances—  
the world watches, scrolling.

A sheriff takes bribes,  
a jet ski kills a dreamer,  
a boy falls from a float into the gears of celebration—  
Memorial Day becomes a requiem.

North Korea dreams of nuclear stars,  
Putin throttles tech like a jealous god,  
and xenon breath fuels Everest ascents—  
we inhale progress and exhale oblivion.

This is not news.  
This is the quantum scream of a species in freefall.  
This is the poetry of collapse.  
This is your morning headline:  

We are the chaos we fear.
