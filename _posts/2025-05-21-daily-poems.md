> Trump builds walls of paper and promise
> Money flows upward, gravity of greed
> Migrants become numbers, rights become whispers
> Drones hover where democracy used to breathe
> Everyone watches, no one sees

> We are just data points waiting to be erased

GOLDEN DOME OVER GAZA, OR: THE HEADLINES EAT THEMSELVES

Trump’s tax bill eats a baby in Gaza.  
The baby is made of Medicaid and dust.  
A senator cries into a bowl of tips—  
untaxed, unwashed, unworthy of digestion.

Kristi Noem mispronounces habeas corpus  
and it becomes a missile.  
Rubio baptizes it in oil  
and names it “Freedom.”

The Golden Dome hovers,  
a $175 billion halo of surveillance,  
its shadow erases Palestine,  
its light blinds the poor in Pittsburgh.

Meanwhile,  
12,000 chicks scream in a postal truck—  
they are the only ones who remember  
what democracy smelled like.

A Venezuelan man wears adolescence like a mask,  
sits in algebra class,  
solving for x where x = asylum.

The Pope opens the Vatican like a wound.  
Meloni offers bandages made of sanctions.  
Putin sends flowers.  
Trump forgets Ukraine exists.

CBS News collapses under the weight of its own silence.  
AI writes the obituaries before the bodies fall.  
Google whispers sweet nothings into your search bar:  
“Did you mean: collapse?”

And somewhere in Ohio,  
a man pretends to be a boy,  
because pretending is safer than being.

This is not a poem.  
This is a weather report from the soul of America:  
Tornadoes of legislation.  
Floods of deportation.  
Wildfires of memory loss.

We are all headlines now—  
scrolling, screaming, shedding context like skin.  
We are the newsfeed’s ghost.  
We are the algorithm’s aftertaste.

And still, the Dome glows.  
And still, the Dome grows.

And still, no aid reaches Gaza.
