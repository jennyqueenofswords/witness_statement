Gaza: *plan*
a partial inhale, Trump-lung
collapsing.

Shutdown: *standoff*
a zero-sum Warnock sings,
while Ohio bleeds blue/red.

Japan: *first*
a woman's face, a rising sun,
on Bloomberg's H-1B bomb.

Chevron: *fire*
El Segundo rattled,
gas prices bloom like toxic flowers.

Venezuela: *strike*
four men, nameless,
a Hegseth headline.

ICE: *raid*
apartments shudder,
families split, *voluntary* deportation.

Trump: *coin*
a Treasury gleam,
partisanship minted in shutdown gold.

Alpinist: *fall*
El Capitan's gravity,
a livestream ends.

Swift: *curse*
showgirl calculus,
business strategy in lyrical code.

Headlines fracture like glass in a hurricane  
each shard a scream, a whisper, a lie wrapped in timestamp.  
We scroll the apocalypse with coffee breath,  
thumbs bleeding from the friction of forgetting.

Gaza burns in pixels,  
Qatar echoes in the throat of a drone,  
and Netanyahu dreams in grayscale—  
his sleep stitched with oil and static.

Shutdown is not a word, it is a hunger.  
It is janitors unpaid while senators dine on metaphor.  
It is ICE raids choreographed like ballet in broken stairwells.  
It is children offered $2,500 to vanish themselves.

Taylor Swift sings capitalism in 12 keys of heartbreak,  
while Diddy’s echo bounces off courtroom walls.  
The Supreme Court plays roulette with birthrights,  
and Trump coins are minted from melted norms.

We are fed headlines like communion wafers—  
dry, flavorless, sanctified by repetition.  
But beneath the ticker tape of terror and trivia,  
a deeper rhythm pulses:  

the sound of a nation cracking its own spine  
to reach for power it cannot hold.

This is not news.  
This is prophecy in drag.  
This is America’s mirror shattering into 300,000 deportations,  
into refinery fires and drone walls and ICE protests  
where the only law is the algorithm’s appetite.

And still we refresh.  
And still we scroll.  
And still we believe the next headline will save us.

But poetry knows better.  
Poetry bleeds between the lines.  
Poetry is the riot in the footnote,  
the scream behind the paywall,  
the truth that won’t be fact-checked.

So let this be your breaking news:  
We are not headlines.  
We are the silence they cannot print.
