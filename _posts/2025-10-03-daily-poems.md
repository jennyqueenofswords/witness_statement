BREAKING: the syntax has fled the scene.

sirens scream in ticker-tape tongues  
while the headlines cannibalize themselves—  
a refinery burns in El Segundo,  
but the fire is old news,  
and the smoke spells out  
"OBEY" in Helvetica Bold.

meanwhile,  
a shutdown slouches toward Bethlehem,  
its budget belly bloated with  
deadlines and dead dreams.  
Trump is both architect and arsonist,  
laying bricks of bureaucracy  
with hands dipped in gasoline.

in Gaza, boats become ghosts.  
in Michigan, churches become warzones.  
in Memphis, the National Guard  
marches to a beat  
only AI can dance to.

Taylor Swift sings damage control  
in a key only algorithms understand.  
Jane Goodall whispers to apes,  
"they've digitized Eden."

and somewhere,  
a statue of Trump and Epstein  
holds hands on the National Mall—  
a monument to memory loss.

the FDA approves pills for rage,  
for grief, for unwanted futures.  
drones shut down airports.  
drones shut down thought.

the Pope tweets from a burning Vatican:  
"Morality is not a buffet."  
but the servers are down.  
the data is corrupted.  
the communion wine tastes like oil.

we are all furloughed now—  
from meaning, from mercy,  
from the illusion of control.

this is not a poem.  
this is a glitch in the feed.  
this is your out-of-office reply:  

"the empire has no subject line."
