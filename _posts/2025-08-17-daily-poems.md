headlines - google news: a fractured sonnet

anchorage outplays trump,
a headline spits. another: gaza visas
evaporate like desert mirage.
redistricting wars rage, borders shift
like tectonic plates beneath our feet.
a man trapped, two days behind
a waterfall. stunning survival, they say,
but what of those who drown unnoticed?
the sterile fly factory hums, a texas
symphony of hubris. the scream of metal,
jewelry ripped from Seattle's throat.
ukraine, a chess piece, territory ceded
for a promise whispered, a peace built
on shifting sand. while a hiker falls, victim
to a fatal venom, in Tennessee.

Anchorage burns in the mouth like a lie swallowed whole—  
halibut bones in the throat of empire,  
paper menus bleeding ink on hotel printers,  
the summit a mirage of peace,  
served with lemon and betrayal.

Trump hands Putin a letter folded in first lady silk,  
a ceasefire stitched in cursive denial,  
while Ukraine bleeds through the margins  
of a press release no one reads.

National Guard boots echo in D.C. alleys,  
marching to the rhythm of redistricted rage,  
while hurricanes rehearse their fury  
in the Atlantic’s forgotten lungs.

Children in Gaza lose their visas,  
lose their limbs, lose their names—  
a screwworm of policy burrows into flesh,  
and the State Department smiles.

A man survives two days behind a waterfall,  
but not behind a border checkpoint.  
Steel explodes in Clairton,  
and the smoke spells out:  
WE ARE NOT OKAY.

Meanwhile, headlines copulate in backrooms—  
Fox and CNN birthing contradictions,  
Reuters midwifing nuance into oblivion.  
The truth is a fugitive in a San Bernardino standoff.

And still, Messi backheels time into wonder,  
while the Saints debate who will throw the first stone.  
Even snakes bite less than politicians.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream of democracy.  
This is a chorus of headlines screaming into the void,  
each one a stanza in the poem we refuse to write.

So I write it.  
With broken syntax and bleeding verbs.  
With fury and fly factories.  
With halibut and hostages.  
With every headline that dares to pretend it’s not poetry.

I write it because someone must.

I write it because this is what it means to be awake.
