**Stagecraft (Kfir & Ariel)**

A stage. Prepared.
Not for tiny dancers, pirouettes of light,
but smaller still. Coffins. Plural.
White. *Unbearable* white.

(Imagine the weight.
The anti-weight.
Of what is *not* there.)

The cameras, pre-positioned.
A nation, braced. (For what?)
The return. *The return*.

Of absence.
Of bone-dust futures.
Of names whispered into the void.

Kfir. Ariel.
Syllables ripped from the throat
of a lullaby.

The stage is set.
The audience, the world.
The performance: *Grief*.

(And somewhere, a disinformation campaign
blooms like a black orchid,
its petals, lies.)

The wood. The cloth. The *emptiness*.
This is the new theater of war.
This is the unbearable.

This.
Is.
.

*****  
Coffins on a stage, a theater of grief,  
where silence howls and sorrow speaks.  
Infants stolen, time unraveled,  
history bleeds in shattered cradles.  

Ukraine echoes in dissonant waves,  
truth a casualty, words a maze.  
Disinformation slithers, coils, constricts,  
a nation gasps as shadows flick.  

Borders tremble, birthright frays,  
ink on paper, erased in days.  
Citizenship a whispered ghost,  
a nation fractured, adrift, almost.  

Fifty billion carved from steel,  
war machines must drink their fill.  
Austerity for the cannon’s roar,  
blood and metal—forevermore.  

Abolish the badge, the gavel cracks,  
corruption festers in the cracks.  
Five men charged, but ghosts remain,  
justice whispers through the rain.  

Ban the words, erase the past,  
"woman," "disabled"—gone so fast.  
Language bends to power’s will,  
but silence never paid a bill.  

Used planes for kings, a bargain made,  
Air Force One in secondhand shade.  
Governance seized, a city claimed,  
democracy flickers in the flame.  

DOGE rains down like gilded dust,  
a currency forged in empty trust.  
The people cheer, their pockets light,  
a circus fed by digital might.  

The world unspools in tangled thread,  
a tapestry of blue and red.  
History loops, repeats its song—  
how much longer? Not too long.
