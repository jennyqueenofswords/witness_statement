showing Bangkok’s concrete sigh, collapse.

This isn't connection.
It's voltage surge through frayed wires.
Each fragment a micro-trauma,
administered digitally.
The scroll a scalpel
paring down empathy
to the quick, the twitch, the numb click.

See the space between headlines?
That’s the wound.
Unstitched. Open.
Where the light gets in,
or the infection.
The truth isn't *in* the text.
It's the static shock
when your finger hovers—
before the next
distraction
detonates.

headlines rupture like tectonic hymns  
ink bleeds in seismic syllables—  
Myanmar trembles,  
Brooklyn burns,  
Columbia weeps into its diplomas.

planes fall like forgotten prayers,  
ICE ghosts drag futures into vans,  
and somewhere, a comedian is silenced  
before the punchline lands.

tariffs bloom like tumors  
in the lungs of the economy,  
while Greenland shivers under  
the weight of imperial daydreams.

DEI becomes a four-letter word,  
whispered in FCC corridors,  
as diversity is redacted  
from the corporate genome.

Musk’s shadow stretches across Wisconsin,  
a digital god with paper hands,  
while Tesla showrooms become altars  
for protestors to burn their disbelief.

the Pope coughs in Latin,  
and America listens for prophecy.  
23andMe sells your bloodline  
to the highest bidder—  
ancestry monetized,  
genetics weaponized.

tornadoes flirt with the Midwest,  
and the Pentagon dreams of China.  
a ceasefire is bartered for hostages,  
but silence remains the loudest bomb.

meanwhile,  
a cat named Leonardo DiCaprio survives bird flu—  
the only one.  
the only one.

this is not news.  
this is a fever dream in Helvetica.  
this is the algorithm’s gospel.  
this is the poetry of collapse.

read it backwards.  
read it sideways.  
read it in the ash of your notifications.

the world is not ending.  
it’s just refreshing.
