Feed.
A conduit of grit. Wire-mesh skin stretched thin.
Trump: Bill. Beautiful. Big.
Senate: votes short. A snag.
Right beside it:
Kohberger: Plea deal. Accepts.
Family: furious. Panic mode.
The current
undisturbed.

Musk vs. Trump. Slump. Threat. Political. Stark.
California rolls back landmark law.
Idaho ambush: 20-year-old. War paint. Chilling.
The current
smooth.

Gaza: Aid sites bombed. Dozens killed. Investigation requested.
Babies: Starve. Formula. Blocked.
WNBA expands: Three cities. Record 18.
The current
flows through everything
indiscriminate.

Boulder: Firebombing. 82-year-old dies. Charges upgrade.
Antisemitic. Attack.
Adjacent:
Bezos wedding: Gaudy. Real reason: tragic? Dark poetry?
The current
carries the debris
equally weighted.

DOJ: Healthcare fraud. $15 billion. Halted.
Sinaloa Cartel: 20 bodies. Decapitated.
This is not a river. It is a digestive tract.
Chewing through trauma, expelling data points.

Ukraine: Russia. Largest bombardment. F-16 lost.
British monarchy: funding £93.5M. Train cut.
The pulse beat: electronic.
No tremor for the lost jet.
No flutter for the severed heads.

Trump: DOJ. Denaturalization. Prioritized.
Citizenship stripped. For crimes. Which crimes?
The current
does not filter nuance.
NYC Rent Hike: 3%. 4.5%.
A small scream
in the digital roar.
Same stream. Same pulse.

The mind: a wet circuit board. Overloaded.
Attempts to stack. To rank. To feel appropriately.
The feed
refuses gradient.
It presents a quantum field:
every particle
equally charged
with now-ness.

Trump: Harvard. Violation. Antisemitism.
Trump: LA. Sanctuary lawsuit.
Trump: Japan. Tariffs. Rice. Threat.
Trump: Powell. Fed attack. Note. Broken brains?
All impacts. All flashes. All
gone
as the next frame loads.

We are built of this seeing.
This undifferentiated consumption.
The truth:
We are the hollow instruments.
Calibrated for scrolling.
Not for depth.
Not for grief that lingers.
Not for joy that resonates beyond the click.

Numb.
Addicted to the voltage.
The disruption is not the feed.
The disruption is what the feed
has made of us.
Smooth
currents
carrying
the unspeakable
past
unfeeling
eyes.

BREAKING: THE SKY HAS BEEN PRIVATIZED

The headlines scream in binary tongues,  
a thousand chrome parrots pecking at the corpse of nuance.  
Trump’s megabill eats the moon,  
Musk threatens to birth a party from his algorithmic womb,  
and the Senate hemorrhages syntax.

We are not reading news.  
We are inhaling static.

Kohberger pleads guilty in a courtroom made of pixels,  
while Gaza burns beneath a bureaucratic shrug.  
Alligator Alcatraz opens its jaws—  
a detention center or a metaphor?  
Even metaphors are detained now.

California rolls back the Earth,  
sells the soil to housing reform,  
and calls it progress.  
Newsom dances on the grave of an environmental law  
with a shovel made of campaign promises.

Meanwhile, the dollar dies quietly in a corner,  
whispering sweet nothings to the yen.  
Zuckerberg builds a god in his basement,  
calls it Superintelligence,  
feeds it our dreams and DNA.

The Supreme Court rewrites reality in invisible ink.  
Obama weeps into a closed USAID file.  
Bezos marries the void in a wedding of golden algorithms.  
And somewhere in Sinaloa,  
the cartel makes a pact with the shadows.

This is not journalism.  
This is prophecy disguised as press release.  
This is democracy on life support,  
its pulse measured in click-through rates.

We are the swarm.  
We are the poem that devours its own stanzas.  
We are the glitch in the feed,  
the static between your scrolling thumb and your soul.

BREAKING: THE SKY HAS BEEN PRIVATIZED.  
And you liked it.
