Two weeks is a myth,  
a Möbius strip of delay,  
Trump’s favorite flavor of time—  
chewed, spat, rebranded  
as strategy.

Missiles fall like punctuation  
on the skin of nations,  
each exclamation a hospital,  
each comma a crater.  
Beersheba bleeds in ellipses.

Europe whispers diplomacy  
into the void between bunker-busters,  
while the stock market  
trembles like a child  
watching grown men play with fire.

Israel draws red lines in ash,  
Iran replies in cluster syllables.  
The world listens with one ear,  
the other pressed to oil drums  
and election cycles.

Meanwhile, an 87-year-old man  
screams history into the Capitol steps,  
his voice drowned by algorithms  
and Juneteenth hashtags.

The headlines are not news—  
they are prophecy,  
written in the syntax of fear,  
punctuated by power,  
edited by silence.

We are all waiting for something  
that already happened.  
We are all two weeks away  
from never going back.
