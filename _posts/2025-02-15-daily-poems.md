## Gemini (Model 1)

*****
(Gulf of Mexico / *Gulf of Forgetting*)

The bourbon, blessed, a holy / unholy water.
Kentucky slick, sliding down throats
that swallow press passes, whole.

          (Air Force One, grounded. A bird
           clipped, mid-sentence.)

D.O.G.E. – a bark, a bite, a digital
leash. Three men, shirts stretched taut
over manufactured conviction, demand

          (what? Transparency? Or just
           another locked door?)

Hegseth, in Europe, a blunt instrument
hammering nails into a coffin
already overflowing. Alliances,

          (fractured, like bone china
           dropped from a great height.)

Adams, off the hook. A city exhales,
a cloud of something foul, something
unaccounted for. The scales, unbalanced.

          (Justice, blindfolded,
           stumbling in the dark.)

Dekel-Chen. *Released.* A word, a cage
unlatched. But the echo –
a phantom limb, twitching.

          (October 7th, a date
           branded on the skin of the world.)

Six thousand agents. *Shift.*
From chasing shadows to rounding up
the living. The border, a razor wire

          (cutting through flesh, through families,
           through the illusion of sanctuary.)

Mass layoffs. Anger, a wildfire
consuming the dry tinder of
federal service. *Shrink.* The word,

          (a tourniquet, choking the flow
           of something vital.)

Musk, a spider at the center
of a web spun from influence,
from access, from the quiet hum

          (of power, unchecked,
           unquestioned, *un-*. )

The news, a shattered mirror.
Reflecting fragments.
*This* is the fractured whole.

Hostage Syntax: A Quantum Dissolution

fragments of ceasefire scatter
                    like bureaucratic dust
                                 hanging between nation-states

Eric Adams' charges collapse
    probability waves of corruption
        dissolving into white noise

federal workers: layered bodies
    trembling at the edge of systemic rupture
        each pink slip a quantum entanglement

Musk's influence: viral algorithm
    consuming governmental membrane
        white house neurons flickering

bourbon blessed by papal hands
    transmuting liquid into sacred currency
        charity as linguistic alchemy

deportation as verb
    DHS agents: human sorting machines
        geography becomes weaponized grammar

three men in DOGE shirts
    demanding files like digital shamans
        San Francisco's bureaucratic skin
            peeling back to reveal
                impossible transparencies

we are all hostages
    of narrative
        of power
            of language

## GPT (Model 4)

*****  
Hostage breath, exhaled in ceasefire’s brittle hands,  
chains unshackled, yet shadows still cling—  
a name whispered through bullet-riddled air,  
Sagui, Sagui, syllables stitched in grief.  

Corruption melts like ice in the Hudson,  
Adams walks free, justice a marionette,  
strings pulled by unseen hands,  
the gavel a ghost in a courtroom of silence.  

Federal workers drown in pink slip tides,  
anger, chaos, confusion—  
a trinity of despair marching through cubicles,  
the hum of fluorescent lights now a dirge.  

Musk, a comet crashing through bureaucracy,  
White House walls tremble at his orbit,  
gravity bends to his will—  
who commands the stars when the sky is for sale?  

Bourbon baptized by papal ink,  
Kentucky’s amber gospel poured for charity,  
a sip of salvation in a world on fire,  
the Pope’s signature a benediction of burn.  

Hegseth stomps through Europe’s fragile halls,  
Trump’s nod a crown of thorns,  
allies recoil, diplomacy fractures—  
a handshake turned to a fist.  

The Gulf of Mexico swallows press credentials,  
Air Force One lifts off without witness,  
words erased before they are spoken,  
truth exiled to the tarmac.  

Cabinet doors swing open to unorthodox ghosts,  
power assembled like mismatched puzzle pieces,  
the picture unclear but the grip firm—  
history rewritten in real time.  

DHS pivots, eyes locked on deportation’s cold calculus,  
6,000 agents shift their aim—  
bullets no longer chase traffickers,  
but those who dared to dream.  

DOGE shirts at City Hall, absurdity made flesh,  
files demanded in meme-laced tongues,  
San Francisco blinks in disbelief—  
reality now a punchline with no laughter.  

The world spins reckless, untethered,  
newsprint ink bleeding into prophecy—  
who writes the ending when the pages burn?
