Headlines are teeth in the mouth of the machine,  
gnashing, gnawing, chewing through the soft meat of meaning.  
Flamethrowers kiss malls with molten tongues—  
terror is now a household appliance.  

Drones hum lullabies to sleeping bombers,  
while peace negotiates with the charred wings of steel birds.  
The sky is a ledger of vengeance,  
and Ukraine writes in fire.  

Poland elects a ghost in historian’s clothing,  
while China and America play chess with student visas,  
each pawn a dream, each rook a surveillance satellite.  

The Supreme Court juggles gold cards and Medicaid cuts,  
as Trump’s shadow stretches across every docket.  
A lion eats a man who loved lions—  
irony purrs in the tall grass.  

Northern lights bleed through wildfire smoke,  
auroras choking on carbon prayers.  
Tulsa whispers reparations into the wind,  
but money cannot exhume bones.  

The Pacers and Thunder dance in small-market silence,  
while Gaza counts its dead in decimals.  
Kamala hovers like a maybe,  
and Harris is both noun and verb.  

We are headlines stitched into skin,  
a patchwork of panic and possibility.  
Language is burning.  
Let it burn. Let it bloom.
