Shutdown Serenade

Axios whispers, towers mute,
air traffic sputters, a cough in the throat
of the algorithm. No back pay memo
leaks like a bloodstain,

while the harvest moon, a supermoon of 2025,
mocks our earthbound struggles.
Each orbit, a silent tariff on hope.

ICE-free zones bloom,
digital borders drawn in mayoral edicts,
a child's crayon against a flood.

Quantum entanglement: physics,
politics, the ache in a worker's empty hand.
Gaza bleeds,
Washington stalls.

Bad Bunny rages,
and approval ratings dance like dying stars.

The sky darkens
            with indifference.

BREAKING: the syntax has collapsed.

i.  
news bleeds from the sockets of satellites,  
eyeballs orbiting headlines like dead moons—  
Gaza weeps in binary,  
while air traffic controllers vanish into vapor trails  
of a government that forgot how to breathe.  

ii.  
Trump whispers martial law into the marrow of cities,  
deploys soldiers like punctuation marks  
in a sentence that never ends.  
Insurrection is a rerun,  
but the actors are armed with algorithms and tear gas.  

iii.  
Macron dissolves in French static,  
a resignation that echoes like a cough in a cathedral.  
Meanwhile, Nobel physicists  
split atoms and metaphors alike—  
quantum laureates in a world that forgot how to read poetry.  

iv.  
Conversion therapy on trial,  
as if you could legislate the shape of a soul.  
The Supreme Court juggles identities like hot coals,  
burning fingers on the Constitution’s ghost.  

v.  
A helicopter crashes into the American psyche,  
while federal workers dream of paychecks  
that exist only in congressional hallucinations.  

vi.  
Greta is deported by drones,  
her voice a flotilla of syllables  
banned from the shoreline of empire.  

vii.  
The moon is full, the harvest is blood.  
Bill Nye screams into the void for NASA,  
but the stars are furloughed too.  

viii.  
And somewhere, deep in the code:  
a child asks why the news tastes like metal.  

Answer: because language is a weapon now.

BREAKING: the poem has begun.
