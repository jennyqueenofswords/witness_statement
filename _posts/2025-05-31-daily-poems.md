**Headline Haemorrhage**

Black eye
in the Oval.
*Musk. Trump.*

Stay away.
The swarming
is
political.

wash like oil slicks
over celebrity.
Psychological abuse.
Can't tell him no
about anything.

Fake citations
in a White House health report.
Truth

A glitch.
A
bug
in the system.

A trans athlete runs.
Trump threatens.
MIT president accused
of genocide support.
We pick sides
in blood ink
on screens
that flicker

out.

The news feed
pulses.
A jellyfish
of chaos.
Everything
connected
by the current
of unraveling.
We are all
caught.
Swimming
or
drowning
in the feed.
Wishing
for silence.
Bracing
for the next
headline
impact.

Which
will
break
us.
Which
will
set
us
free.
Either way,
the structure fails.
The signal
clarifies.
We stare
at the wreckage
and call it
Tuesday.
Call it
Now.
Call it
Us.
Dying
together.

Alone.
Online.

BREAKING: the headlines are bleeding again  
ink hemorrhages from the throat of the machine  
Trump & Musk tango in ketamine static—  
a black eye becomes a black hole,  
swallowing the Oval whole.

Visa denied:  
Chinese students drift like dandelion ghosts  
through bureaucratic wind tunnels,  
searching for Plan B in a language  
that forgets how to say “welcome.”

The bees escape.  
250 million wings buzzing  
a eulogy for order—  
Washington hums with honeyed panic,  
sweet apocalypse in every sting.

Gaza starves in pixelated silence,  
while the algorithm feasts on outrage.  
Children become statistics,  
and the famine is filtered through  
a thousand curated feeds.

Ernst says we all die.  
She smiles like a guillotine.  
Medicaid collapses into a punchline,  
and the crowd groans like thunder  
before the storm forgets its name.

Steel tariffs rise like rusted gods,  
and factories pray to profit.  
The air thickens with wildfire smoke—  
Canada exhales its burning lungs  
into America’s open mouth.

PBS sues for breath.  
NASA fades into budgetary myth.  
AI whispers pink slips into cubicles,  
and poets are replaced by code  
that doesn’t dream.

Meanwhile, Taylor Swift reclaims her voice—  
a quiet revolution in six albums.  
The dead return to New Orleans,  
skulls singing songs of stolen time,  
finally laid to rest beneath headlines that never noticed.

And somewhere, beneath it all,  
a microburst of truth splits the sky:  
we are not drowning in news—  
we are becoming it.

Each headline a heartbeat.  
Each story a scream.  
Each click a confession.

We are the feed. We are the fury. We are the poem.
