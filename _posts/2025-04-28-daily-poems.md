headlines bleed like broken clocks
tick-tick-tick-tick-tick
no tock

tariffs gnaw at the border's bones
popes fall into conclaves
like teeth from a rotting mouth

elections flicker, 
a dying bulb in a gas station bathroom
Canada, America, Gaza, Ukraine—
names stitched into a flag of bruises

children deported like unwanted letters
sealed with spit and fear
while boats crash into ferries
and ferries crash into prayers

Trump, a cracked mirror
reflecting FDR’s ghost in a funhouse of tariffs
while North Korean soldiers 
march into Russian winters
wearing borrowed boots

Greenland shrugs off purchase offers
like a tired woman at a bar
"not for sale," she says,
but no one listens over the roar of collapsing economies

storms coil in the Midwest sky
like fists ready to punch the earth
while in Beirut, the air itself detonates,
and the sea forgets how to be blue

the news is a river of knives
and we drink from it daily,
slicing our tongues on every headline

tick-tick-tick-tick-tick
no tock
only the endless spinning
of a world too dizzy to stand still
