*****
A ticker tape of tragedies, a scroll of stolen breath,
Headlines scream in fractured font, a cacophony of death.
Gaza bleeds a pixelated wound, while diplomats convene,
Ukraine a chessboard, pawns exchanged, a ceasefire unseen.

Mia Love, a name now etched in stone, a fleeting, fractured star,
While Trump, a golem built of greed, wages his legal war.
Deportation's shadow looms, a scythe across the land,
Law firms bend, a craven bow, to power's iron hand.

Erdogan, a sultan's grip, on Istanbul's dissent,
Greenland shivers, not from cold, but threats malevolently sent.
Lawyers threatened, justice gagged, a memo stained with spite,
The Supreme Court, a battleground, for darkness and for light.

Jessica Aber, silence falls, a life abruptly ceased,
While Gaza's exodus unfolds, a human tide released.
South Korea's court, a fragile hope, a leader reinstated,
Wildfires rage, a burning grief, a landscape devastated.

Venezuela, a broken pact, deportations restart,
Schumer stands, a hollow shell, a leader torn apart.
The Pope, released, a fragile frame, a blessing whispered low,
While Easter eggs and corporate greed, a grotesque, gilded show.

California's fire captain slain, a wife in shadowed flight,
Education's gutted corpse, a future robbed of light.
Canada's election, whispers rise, of threats across the line,
Mass shootings bloom, a crimson stain, in Las Cruces' shrine.

Gaza's death toll, numbers climb, a statistic's cold embrace,
Mahmoud Khalil, a name that screams, injustice in this place.
Columbia, a battleground, for funding and for thought,
Cherry blossoms bloom in vain, a beauty dearly bought.

Debt ceiling looms, a fiscal cliff, a nation poised to fall,
Tariffs dance, a dangerous game, a threat to one and all.
Espionage, a whispered fear, as federal ranks are thinned,
Netanyahu, a clenched fist, against the legal wind.

United Airlines, callous hands, a child's life on the line,
Stock markets surge, a fevered dream, on whispers of decline.
Patrick Henry's ghost cries out, for liberty denied,
UConn's dreams, a shattered hoop, a champion's humbled pride.

Tiger Woods, a love affair, with shadows of the past,
Half a million souls unmoored, their legal futures cast
Into the void, a cruel decree, a nation's broken vow,
23andMe, a bankrupt plea, genetic secrets now

Exposed and sold, a fragile trust, betrayed for paltry gain,
Conan's laughter, laced with scorn, a mockery of pain.
The USMNT, a fallen star, a nation's hopes betrayed,
Maryland's buzzer-beater rings, a victory parade.

Kentucky's roar, a Sweet Sixteen, a banner held on high,
While border walls and scanned phones, a freedom starts to die.
Snow White's debut, a poisoned fruit, a box office despair,
Depardieu, a fallen star, accused, a trial to bear.

Wisconsin's triumph, hockey's crown, a victory hard-won,
Othello's stage, a power play, where darkness has begun.
Fantasy's draft, a fleeting hope, of heroes yet to rise,
While NASCAR's roar, a fleeting thrill, beneath uncertain skies.

Izzo's tears, a coach's pain, a victory hard-fought,
Lindsey Vonn, a comeback trail, with lessons dearly bought.
Hovland's win, a golfer's grace, a triumph over doubt,
Cooper Flagg, a rising star, as Baylor's flame burns out.

Wrestling's mat, a political stage, for cheers and jeers to blend,
Sean Miller's move, a coach's choice, a journey without end.
Carolina's storm, a hockey sweep, against the Anaheim tide,
Sergio's miss, a golfer's grief, a chance at glory denied.

Formula One, a checkered flag, a race of speed and might,
Aaron Rodgers, whispers swirl, of Steelers in the night.
James Hardie's deal, a merger's dance, a market's shifting ground,
George Foreman's death, a legend lost, a silence all around.

Monsanto's guilt, a billion-dollar price, for poison in the soil,
Arkansas's rise, a basketball dream, a victory from turmoil.
Wyatt Hendrickson's stunning win, a wrestler's faith proclaimed,
Will Wade's return, a coach reborn, a reputation reclaimed.

A fractured mirror, shattered truths, reflected in the news,
A world on fire, a human cost, a future we may lose.
The headlines scream, a constant drone, of chaos and despair,
But in the cracks, a fragile hope, a whispered, urgent prayer.

*****  
Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the wind,  
war whispers in Riyadh, a Black Sea ceasefire  
drowns in the undertow of unspoken deals.  

Mia Love fades, ink smudged on history’s page,  
a name swallowed by the tide of breaking news,  
while deportations script exile in bureaucratic hands.  

Trump’s shadow lengthens, stretching over courtrooms,  
over Greenland’s ice, over Columbia’s lecture halls—  
a specter rewriting law with a clenched fist.  

Cherry blossoms bloom in Tokyo, indifferent,  
petals drifting like fallen verdicts,  
like bodies unnamed in Gaza’s dust.  

Debt ceilings crack like old cathedral domes,  
tariffs tighten their noose around the throat of trade,  
and somewhere, a wildfire eats the Carolinas whole.  

Tiger Woods kisses Vanessa Trump,  
a headline dressed as prophecy,  
while Shakespeare’s Iago smirks from the wings.  

The Pope eats gelato, the markets shudder,  
23andMe unravels its own DNA in bankruptcy courts,  
and Patrick Henry’s ghost screams into static airwaves:  

Give me liberty or give me—  
another breaking story.
