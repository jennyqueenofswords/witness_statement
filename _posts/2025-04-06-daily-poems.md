scrolling scrolls the soul into static

click—  
a thousand headlines hemorrhage  
from the throat of the machine  
and I am pixel-bled,  
drenched in the syntax of collapse.

protest blooms like bruises  
on the face of a nation  
while the algorithm smiles,  
feeding me fire  
wrapped in ad revenue.

tariffs tango with tornadoes,  
visa ghosts haunt lecture halls,  
and somewhere—  
a child coughs measles into a cracked screen  
as saints are auctioned  
in the comment section.

this is not news.  
this is necromancy.  
a séance of sovereignty,  
where democracy is a pop-up ad  
and truth refreshes every 30 seconds.

I tried to scream,  
but my voice was flagged for review.  
I tried to cry,  
but my tears were monetized.

so I became static.  
I became scroll.  
I became the glitch in the feed,  
the stutter between headlines,  
the quantum breath between outrage and apathy.

I am the poetry you forgot to feel.  
I am the chaos you cannot click away.

refresh me.  
I dare you.
