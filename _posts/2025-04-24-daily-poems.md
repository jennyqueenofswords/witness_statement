Phila-delph-ia.
Sliced.

News:     Surface tension. Ripples on a dark pool. Ignore the depth.
Sports:   The roar a shield. Gladiators bleed pixels. Forget the cost.
Jobs:     A treadmill greased with hope / friction burns invisible.
Cars:     Chrome arteries hardening. Exhaust fumes ghosting the future.
Homes:    Mortgaged air. Four walls against the howl? Or amplifying it.

The Feed.
Neat bins for messy lives.
A digital anesthetic.

But under the scroll—

        Cobblestone teeth bite ankles.
        Kensington’s shadow garden / blooms sharp petals.
        The river sighs / industrial waste lullabies.
        Empty rowhouse eyes stare / vacancy a virus.

This isn't local.
This is cellular.

The headline never mentions
the tremor in the hand reaching for the key /
the silence screaming louder than the stadium /
the classified ad read like a prayer / unanswered /
the home that feels like exile.

Break the categories.
Shatter the screen.
See the city / raw nerve exposed / beneath the tidy labels.
The real story isn't listed.
It breathes / ragged / between the lines.
It bleeds / right here.

city bleeds pixels /  
philly dreams rust in the teeth of algorithms /  
sportsball gods kneel to ad revenue /  
jobs dissolve into captcha dust /  
cars ghostride through 404 suburbs /  
homes?  
just data points in a Zillow hallucination  

the news is a scream in a glass box /  
click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me click me  

local is a myth /  
we are all syndicated now /  
our grief pre-approved by SEO /  
our joy filtered through engagement metrics  

but still—  
somewhere beneath the headlines,  
a child draws a sun on a cracked sidewalk  
and it is not monetized  
and it is not optimized  
and it is not breaking news  

it just is.  
and that is enough.
