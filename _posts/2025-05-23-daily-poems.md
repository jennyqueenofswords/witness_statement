Headline: a scream in Helvetica  
Trump eats the moon again,  
belches Harvard visas into the void—  
foreign tongues swallowed by executive teeth.  

Belgium’s princess weeps in crimson pixels,  
her crown pixelated,  
her passport revoked by algorithmic decree.  

Crypto kings dine with meme ghosts,  
forks clinking against the bones of ethics,  
while Air Force One is reborn in Qatari silk,  
a Boeing womb for imperial rebirth.  

A cargo ship dreams of gardens,  
crashes into Norwegian sleep—  
man wakes to steel and saltwater in his begonias.  

Meanwhile, Gaza bleeds through bandwidth,  
aid trucks trickle like apologies,  
and the Supreme Court votes 4-4 on God.  

Kermit speaks at Maryland—  
a frog croaks truth in a mortarboard,  
while Tennessee injects silence into a man’s veins.  

Pennies die quietly.  
No funeral. No Lincoln tears.  
Just spreadsheets and copper ghosts.  

The headlines do not blink.  
They multiply like locusts in a fiberoptic sky.  
We read them with our teeth clenched,  
our hearts buffering.  

This is not news.  
This is prophecy in collapse.  
This is America’s mirror, cracked and scrolling.  
This is the poetry of unraveling.
