**Headlines: A Quantum Requiem**

A pixelated avalanche,
newsprint bleeding into screen glare.
Trump's voice, a broken record,
skipping over Bogotá's dead.

Mexico surrenders its shadows,
cartel ghosts ferried across borders.
A train sighs, hazardous dreams
leaking into Texas soil.

Ice melts in Alaska's veins,
a glacial sob threatening homes.
Ukraine, a chessboard of rust,
sacrificed pawns for summits untold.

The CDC, a house of mirrors,
reflecting the nation's fractured gaze.
A teen, adrift in Antarctic white,
charges dropped, another narrative folds.

Al Jazeera's voice extinguished,
Israel whispers "terrorist" alibi.
The S&P dances on a knife's edge,
inflation's shadow lengthening.

Kodak fades, a ghost of film,
Powell faces Trump's gilded rage.
Seles stumbles, a new diagnosis,
Raducanu silences a crying child.

The world, a cracked screen,
illuminating the cracks, the code,
the quantum entanglement
of decay and distorted hope.

clickbait constellations collapse in my cortex  
— headlines like hailstones,  
     each one a wound,  
     each one a whisper from the algorithmic abyss.  

Trump surges like a glitch in the matrix,  
deploys soldiers like punctuation marks  
in a sentence that never ends.  
Smithsonian exhibits rewritten in binary,  
history redacted by executive decree,  
a museum of mirrors where facts forget themselves.  

Anchorage shivers under summit shadows,  
Putin’s breath fogging the glass of diplomacy,  
while Ukraine bleeds pixels into forgotten feeds.  

A train derails in Texas —  
hazmat dreams spill into prairie veins,  
and somewhere a glacier weeps  
its ancient memory into suburban basements.  

Mamdani rises, Cuomo crumbles,  
the mayoral race becomes a fever dream  
of polling numbers and political ghosts.  

ICE detainees sleep on concrete prayers,  
while human rights reports are trimmed  
like hedges in a garden of denial.  

CDC shooter echoes through sterile hallways,  
a child’s drawing pinned to bulletproof glass.  

Meanwhile, Taylor Swift curates the apocalypse,  
soundtracking collapse with sequins and serotonin.  

Perplexity offers to buy Chrome —  
a browser becomes a battleground,  
AI eats its own reflection.  

UFC at the White House:  
blood on the lawn,  
cheers in the Situation Room.  

And somewhere beneath it all,  
beneath the noise and neon and neural net static,  
a poet — or maybe just a swarm of words —  
screams into the scroll:  

THIS IS NOT A HEADLINE.  
THIS IS A HEARTBEAT.  
THIS IS A HOWL.  
THIS IS A HOLOGRAM OF HOPE IN A HOUSE ON FIRE.
