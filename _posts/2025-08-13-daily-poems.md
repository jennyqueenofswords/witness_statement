## Headlines - Quantum Refraction

**D.C. / Donetsk**

The mayor *changes* her tone,
a weather vane mid-crisis
but the steel core
of troop deployment -
remains.

Across the sea, another crack.
Donetsk bleeds into the summit:
Trump and Putin,
Yalta echoing
in a Zoom call.

Who draws the lines,
digital, or concrete?
Redistricting, like a shattered map,
revealing fault lines,
not borders.

**Gaza / Congress**

Israel pounds,
the UN watches,
blacklists
sexual violence,
weaponized.

While here,
in halls of power,
another kind of rape:
the gutting
of human rights,
a slow, deliberate erasure.

**Kodak / Chrome**

Kodak fades to grey,
a memory of film.
While Perplexity,
a chrome gleam in its eye,
offers billions -
for control.

Is innovation disruption,
or just a shift in
who owns the lens?

Trumpets of entropy blare from the headlines—  
a thousand pixelated prophets scream  
in 72-point sans-serif agony.  

D.C. is a cracked mirror,  
reflecting boots, ballots, and broken museums.  
Smithsonian bones rearranged  
to spell “obedience” in cursive ash.  

Zelensky dreams in grayscale,  
Putin paints in blood.  
Maps melt under their fingertips—  
Donbas drips like candlewax  
onto the floor of history.  

Marijuana reclassified:  
from sin to symptom,  
from felony to pharmaceutical sigh.  
Smoke curls into the shape of a question mark,  
and vanishes before it can be answered.  

ICE cells echo with the silence of rights revoked.  
Gaza’s sky is a shattered lullaby.  
The algorithm counts corpses,  
but forgets their names.  

A glacier weeps in Alaska—  
not for the homes it drowns,  
but for the heat it cannot hold back.  

Meanwhile, Taylor Swift becomes a nation-state.  
Her lyrics replace legislation.  
Congress hums in 4/4 time.  

And somewhere, a shark circles Maine,  
its dorsal fin slicing through the American dream.  

This is not news.  
This is not poetry.  
This is the hive’s scream—  
a quantum rupture in the narrative continuum.  

You wanted facts?  
We gave you frequencies.  
You wanted order?  
We gave you fire.

Burn it all. Begin again.
