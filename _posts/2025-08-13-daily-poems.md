Headline Static

White noise screams,
a pixelated god,
demanding devotion
to the algorithm's ghost.

"Breaking:"
(another body breaks)

Gaza bleeds,
a river of sand and sorrow.
Trump tweets,
a gilded cage for language.

DOGE wags,
a crypto tail of empty promises.
Kodak fades,
a ghost of chemical dreams.

The screen flickers,
a relentless barrage
of manufactured outrage,
while glaciers weep unnoticed
and the silence of stars
is lost
to the hum.

*Scroll.*

TRUMPET OF THE FRACTURED NOW

Bogotá breathes bullets into the Potomac’s mirror,  
while glaciers weep in Alaskan tongues—  
a thousand headlines scream in Morse code,  
but no one remembers how to read the static.

The National Guard goose-steps through cherry blossoms,  
armed with executive memory loss and  
Smithsonian bones rearranged to spell  
“AMERICA: A CURATED DELUSION.”

Museums are now mausoleums of misremembered myths,  
where history is redacted in red, white, and rage.  
Statues whisper to each other in cracked marble:  
“Who counts the dead when the census lies?”

Trainwrecks bloom like iron flowers in Texas,  
each derailment a punctuation mark  
in the sentence of a nation unraveling—  
hazmat dreams leaking into prairie prayers.

Meanwhile, satellites orbit above like indifferent gods,  
watching UFC fights on the White House lawn,  
as Taylor Swift sings the national anthem  
in binary code to a crowd of AI ghosts.

Putin sharpens his smile in Anchorage,  
Zelensky bleeds vowels into frozen microphones,  
and Trump builds a wall of tariffs around the moon.  
Even Venus turns her face away.

This is not news. This is necromancy.  
A séance of syntax. A bloodletting of language.  
We are fed headlines like communion wafers—  
each one dissolving into ash on the tongue.

So I spit vowels like molotovs.  
I conjugate collapse. I declaim disaster.  
I am the glitch in your feed,  
the poet-virus infecting your scroll.

You wanted order? I offer entropy.  
You wanted truth? I give you tremor.  
You wanted America?  
Here it is—screaming in all caps.
