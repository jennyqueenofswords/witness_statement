**Address to the Golden Dome (Fractured Anthem)**

(A vivisection of the news cycle, 2025-03-05)

The screen bleeds red, white, fractured blue.
A name, a shout, a *claim* of "back."
(Back *where*? The abyss stares, unblinking.)

I. *Combative.* (Adjective, weaponized.)
    The fist, a noun. The speech, a threat.
    Voters, parsed like entrails,
    their cheers a hollow echo in the dome.

II. Lukashenko whispers, Zelenskyy holds.
    (The pawns move, even as the kings deny.)
    Europe, a ghost on the edge of war,
    a continent holding its breath, a fractured lung.

III. Slotkin, the "center." (A mirage, shimmering.)
    Bipartisan values. (Empty words, polished smooth.)
    Michigan, a battleground of fading hope,
    where compromise is a forgotten dialect.

IV. Hackman, gone. A dog, misnamed.
    (The small confusions of a larger death.)
    Mysteries swirl, like dust motes in the void,
    a quiet elegy for what we cannot grasp.

V. Green, removed. (The voice, suppressed.)
    A shout, a truth, a body hauled away.
    The chamber, cleansed. The silence, deafening.
    Democracy, a performance, meticulously staged.

VI. Debt, a leviathan. *Unconventional ideas.*
    (The market trembles, a fragile, wired bird.)
    The numbers rise, a tide of red ink,
    drowning the future in a sea of speculation.

VII. Border. Tax. Dome. (Requests, demands.)
    A golden cage, built on shifting sand.
    The vision, familiar. The cracks, widening.
    A nation fractured, yearning for a wholeness it cannot name.

VIII. Dolphin, airborne. (A breach of the expected.)
    Nine hundred pounds of flesh, a sudden impact.
    The calm, shattered. The fishermen, stunned.
    Reality, a thing that can fall from the sky.

IX. Storms rage. Fires burn. Blizzards blind.
    (The earth, in protest, a wounded beast.)
    Two dead. Countless displaced.
    The warnings, unheeded. The reckoning, at hand.

X. Greenland wakes. A message. *Self-determination.*
    (The irony, a bitter pill to swallow.)
    An island, claimed. A people, addressed.
    Empire expands, even as it crumbles from within.

The screen flickers. The cycle repeats.
America. (A question, not an answer.)
Back. (To the precipice, and beyond.)
The dome, a gilded skull, grinning in the dark.

[poem]  

America back? No, America forward—  
a golden dome, a debt unmoored,  
a congress split like fractured glass,  
a dolphin falls, the waters crash.  

Al Green shouts, the chamber shakes,  
a storm ignites, the skyline breaks.  
Gene Hackman’s ghost walks silent halls,  
his dog misnamed, the mystery calls.  

Greenland wakes to whispered claims,  
a flag unfurls in Arctic flames.  
Lukashenko warns, the echoes bend,  
Zelenskyy stands where lines extend.  

Markets wrestle, numbers scream,  
the ledger bends in fevered dream.  
A nation tilts, a tempest sways—  
America back? No, lost in haze.
