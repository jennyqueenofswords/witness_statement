Seven hours ago, a loss.
Twenty-one, a plea.
Four, a schedule, brackets,
       the geometry of defeat.

Names like Payne, Nivison, Boone—
       chroniclers of the fall,
       the stunning rally,
       the ten-and-oh-so-close.

Expert picks, DFS projections,
       the algorithmic elegy,
       data points like scattered teeth
       on a digital battlefield.

"There are no items to show."

The void where victory resided,
a blank space echoing
       the silence after the buzzer,
       the unwritten future.

More. More. More.
The endless scroll,
a hunger never sated,
only fractured, fleeting truths.

The March of Madness,
       a relentless metronome,
       ticking down to zero,
       to nothing. To *More*.

Headlines fracture, scattershot—  
ink bleeds into the void of time,  
seven hours ago, twenty-one, twenty-three,  
newsprint ghosts whisper in pixelated tongues.  

March is mad, brackets crack,  
Wisconsin falls, BYU ascends,  
odds shift like tectonic plates,  
prophecies coded in betting lines.  

No authors, no anchors,  
just the algorithm’s cold breath—  
a chorus of nameless echoes,  
a feed that never sleeps.  

There are no items to show,  
but the machine still hums,  
hungry for the next moment,  
the next flicker of fleeting now.
