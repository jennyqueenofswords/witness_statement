**Feed/Fracture**

Headlines hemorrhage pixels. A ticker tape of ghosts.
Alien Enemies Act / midnight ink / cold law / warm bodies pushed back
(Venezuela waits)
while Putin offers Easter / a truce thin as onion skin / Zelenskyy sees only
*impression* / attacks continue / relentless rain.

Vance meets Pope / migration flap / opinions exchanged
like rare coins / over coffee / while elsewhere
SHAME! screams the protest sign / bold font against a blue sky /
Trump’s shadow lengthens / State Dept gutted / draft order / sharp inhale.

Scroll.

The White House lawn / pastel eggs / 30,000 real shells / sponsored by
Amazon / Meta / YouTube / logos bright against the green /
while FSU gunshot echoes / splits brothers / splits silence / mother’s gun.
Pope wishes Happy Easter / briefly / before the pain returns.
Gaza ceasefire called for / Gaza bombed / Netanyahu vows *no choice*.

The feed digests atrocity / anecdote / renders them equivalent grey paste.
Oakland has a mayor (Lee / trailblazer) / Iran talks stall (old dance / new threats)
Deepwater Horizon / fifteen years / the slick still blooms iridescent / on memory’s surface.
RFK Jr. speaks autism / a syntax of harm / while NASA’s oldest returns / Earth a blue marble / seen anew.

Where does the heart land
when the eye drowns?

Between LeBron’s loss (physicality!) / and Yemen’s burning fuel (74 dead / US strikes / Tuesday).
Between WrestleMania’s staged betrayal (Heyman turns!) / and the citizen held / birth certificate useless / against the ICE order glare / Florida law.
Between the MS-13 tattoo (Photoshopped? Real?) / and the Oklahoma bombing’s thirtieth year (Clinton urges / put aside resentments / easier said).

Schedule F looms / efficiency / in erasure.
50,000 federal workers / suddenly precarious / like truth.
The thumb hovers. The synapse fires. Scroll.

The noise isn't the enemy.
It's the anesthetic. Dulling the nerve endings.
The real violence happens in the gaps –
the white space / the skipped beat / the averted gaze / the *like* clicked without reading.

Between the cockfight massacre (Ecuador / fake fatigues / 12 dead)
and the humanoid half-marathon (Beijing / stumbling code / overheating circuits)
lies the unread article / the unfelt connection / the action untaken.

This screen / a mirror / reflecting fragmentation back at us.
Polished smooth / by the relentless scroll.
Each flicker / a tiny detonation / collapsing context / leaving behind
only the bright, empty surface.
And the low hum / of the machine / that feeds us.

Alien enemies sleep in the court’s midnight breath,  
inked in parchment from 1798—  
a law like a rusted jawbone,  
gnawing at the ankles of the present.  

Ceasefires bloom like false lilies in Gaza,  
while drones hum lullabies to the dead.  
Putin paints Easter with smoke,  
Zelenskyy counts ghosts in the rubble.  

JD Vance shakes hands with the Pope,  
while migrant prayers evaporate  
in the Vatican’s marble echo chamber.  
Eggs roll across White House lawns—  
corporate logos stamped on yolk.  

Protesters wear powdered wigs,  
shouting “Shame!” into the algorithm.  
Trump drafts a new America  
with scissors and gasoline.  

Barbara Lee ascends in Oakland,  
a phoenix of policy and pain.  
Meanwhile, Schedule F sharpens its teeth—  
federal workers line up for the guillotine of efficiency.  

A man born in Florida is detained by ICE,  
his birth certificate a paper shield  
against the machinery of suspicion.  

In Ecuador, cockfights end in blood.  
In Illinois, planes fall like forgotten prayers.  
In Beijing, robots run marathons—  
stumbling toward a future that forgets to feel.  

And somewhere beneath it all,  
the Earth spins quietly,  
waiting for us to remember  
how to speak without screaming.
