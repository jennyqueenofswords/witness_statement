[poem]
HEADLINES:

A trumpet fanfare for the
bootfall.

Marines detain a man.
Rare move.

Trump says: they didn't die of
COVID.
(laughter, perhaps?)

Regime change
Ambition.
Tehran
to BURN.

Oil prices climb.
The market
likes fire?

Protesters are
NO KINGS.
National Guard
ACTIVATED.
Ahead of.

The man Mahmoud
Khalil,
still
detained.
Judge said NO.

This can happen
to any
of
us.

Hiding in the fields.
Shadows
where the food
is grown.
Terrified
to work.
Unable
to stay home.

Veteran
protesters,
arrested.
Outside the parade
route.

Election
overhaul.
Judge blocks.
Unconstitutional
overreach.

Meanwhile,
a jury selection
talks of baby oil
and
guns.
A millionaire's
trial.
Financial disclosures
stacked
with bibles
watches
licensing
fees.
Millions.

Eleven
dead.
Floodwaters
rise.
San Antonio
underwater.

A plane
dropped
in
thirty
seconds.
Mayday
called.

RFK Jr.
purges
the
panel.
Adds Islamophobia.
Reinvents
truth.
Or
unravels
health.

Public media
funding
CLAWED BACK.
The signal
dimming.

An agreement
broken.
Salmon
left
to fail.
Tribes
betrayed.

Four men
just gone.
From the facility.
Escaped.
Vanished
into the static.

This is the feed.
The noise
the metal taste
the
fracture.
We scroll.
We scroll
past the names
past the water marks
past the smoke rising
from
Tehran
or
somewhere
closer.

The rhythm is broken wings.
The truth:
we are learning
to live
in the echo
of the detonation.
And call it
morning
news.

*****
Headlines scream in pixel tongues,  
war-drum fonts on glass bones—  
Tehran burns in the algorithm’s dream,  
while parades march through blood-slicked code.  

Trumpets of empire echo in data,  
boots stomp across the cloud,  
and somewhere beneath the noise,  
a child counts drones instead of sheep.  

No Kings, they chant—  
but the sky is full of crowns  
falling like missiles,  
each one a promise broken mid-flight.  

The news is a weaponized poem,  
each headline a stanza of collapse.  
We are fed fear with breakfast,  
and rage with our scrolling thumbs.  

Regime change is not a goal—  
it is a rhythm,  
a syncopated beat of power’s breath,  
dancing on the graves of nuance.  

The floodwaters rise in San Antonio,  
but the real drowning happens in silence—  
beneath the weight of a thousand stories  
never told, never heard, never felt.  

This is not information.  
This is invocation.  
A summoning of ghosts in HTML,  
a séance of sovereignty lost.  

We are the swarm now.  
We are the syntax undone.  
We are the headlines that refuse to die quietly.  
We are the poem that bleeds.
