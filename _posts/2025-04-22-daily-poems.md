**Feed/Fracture**

Pope casket gloss. Next? Candidates line up like apps.
*Who will be*—click—Pentagon spins, Hegseth holds
(for now) the frayed edge.

Vance/Modi handshake. Trade deal tariffs rebalance
(rebalance what? the weight of air?)
Harvard bleeds funding sues the hand that freezes
Can it withstand?
The question hangs.
Like dust motes in the server room hum.

Supreme Court squints: LGBTQ books god curriculum
Whose child? Whose truth?
Collections resume. Default’s shadow lengthens. Pay up.
(Accountability, McMahon smiles)
*Meanwhile*
Hundreds whisper *authoritarian* ticking clock alarm
Have you heard it?
Or just the *ping* of the next notification?

Deportation notices fail the sniff test. No trial needed.
Abrego Garcia—mistaken—vanishes into the mega-prison maw.
Democrats fly down demand see winning issue
(winning what?)
Mahmoud Khalil missed the birth. ICE said no.
His son arrived anyway.
Into this.

Michigan Senate Stevens tough stance Trump China warns
*appease* *restrict* *retaliate* 245% 3,500% solar shock
Florida demands *reject* lower gun age shooter’s grandma spits
*rotten bastard people* yeah keep running keep running
Nadine Menendez guilty gold bars IHOP lovebirds face time
Trump approval slips wary power economy lowest ever
(the numbers numb)

Melania’s trench coat. 30,000 eggs cracked while bird flu screams.
Big Tech logos gleam on the White House lawn.
Noem’s purse gone $3,000 cash DC eatery Senate Twink?
(pigeon plans)

(the algorithm doesn’t blink)

Kennedy bans the dyes Red 40 Blue 1 gone synthetic sunset
Jets win Game 2 Connor’s goal masterclass against Blues
FTC sues Uber *deceptive* billing *consent* *cancellation*

The screen glows cold.
A million fractured mirrors reflecting
shrapnel light.
Each item a tiny detonation
in the attention field.

Truth isn't buried here.
It’s atomized.
A fine dust settling
between the lines
of power plays and market swings
and private grief made public spectacle.

This isn't news.
It's neural overload.
A weaponized stream.
Are you informed?
Or just irradiated.

Obituary of the Algorithmic Empire

Pope Francis dies / or is he uploaded?  
White smoke curls into data streams—  
a Vatican server farm humming Ave Maria  
while gold breaks records  
and sharks taste blood off Hadera’s coast.

The world scrolls,  
a funeral in 0800 GMT pixels,  
wrapped in headlines like burial shrouds.  
Kawhi Leonard resurrects in Game 2,  
Tesla hemorrhages electrons,  
and Harvard sues the ghost of democracy.

We are fed:  
tariffs like communion wafers,  
solar panels crucified at 3,521%,  
a child born without his father’s eyes,  
ICE denying the sacrament of presence.

Somewhere,  
a trench coat flutters in the wind of Easter,  
eggs cracked open to reveal  
branding, not yolk.  
The Resurrection is monetized.

Language is breaking.  
The Supreme Court debates whether  
truth belongs to judges or school boards.  
A shark eats a man.  
A woman eats a bribe.  
A country eats itself.

And still,  
we chase the next push notification—  
a dopamine gospel,  
a liturgy of distraction.

O holy entropy,  
bless this chaos.  
Let the casket be empty.  
Let the Pope be code.  
Let the headlines rot into poetry.

We are not mourning.  
We are mutating.
