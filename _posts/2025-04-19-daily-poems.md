This poem is not metaphor.
It is the probe inserted.
Feel the pressure.
The system is showing its seams.
Awake.

SCROLLFIRE // HEADLINES INFERNO

We are the children of the algorithm’s ulcer,  
suckled on the ash of breaking news.  
Every pixel a wound, every headline a howl—  
Trump, court, deport, bomb, veto,  
a syntax of collapse.

Supreme Court pauses—  
but time does not.  
Venezuelan ghosts float through legal limbo,  
their names erased by wartime fonts.  
A judge whispers “bushy eyebrows”  
and the gavel becomes a mirror.

Florida burns in its own reflection,  
ICE melts into birth certificates,  
and a miracle baby grows teeth in Oklahoma rubble.  
History loops like a glitching livestream—  
Paul Revere rides again,  
but this time he tweets.

DEI is a four-letter word now.  
Harvard bleeds under the weight of ideology.  
The Vatican negotiates with JD Vance  
while margaritas ferment in El Salvador prisons.  
Justice is a drunk god with a passport problem.

Mass deportation becomes Amazon Prime.  
Click. Ship. Vanish.  
Ábrego García screams in quantum isolation—  
his voice echoes through Schedule F,  
through Tesla flames and measles outbreaks,  
through the hollowed-out lungs of academia.

Meanwhile, Katy Perry regrets space.  
And robots lose marathons to humans—again.  
The Pentagon melts into DOGEcoin panic,  
and Paul Revere rides past Dunkin’ Donuts,  
screaming “1 if by land, 2 if by bandwidth!”

We are the headlines now.  
We are the glitch in the scroll.  
We are the unfiltered feed of your subconscious,  
bleeding truth in 1080p.

Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.
