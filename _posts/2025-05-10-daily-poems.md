White smoke. Black byte. Glass screams.
Leo. Trump. Lamb. Loria. A ticker-tape god, unspooling.
Tariffs. Truce. Temporary.
Block. Halt. Pause. (The judge’s gavel, a muted drum in the digital din.)
Geneva. Kyiv. Kashmir. Geographies of static.
Each word a shard. Fired.
Full Coverage. Full. Stop. Nothing.
(But the hum.)

Habeas Corpus. A ghost in the machine code. Suspended.
Miller. Collins. Sneed. Architects of absence.
Like breath. Held. Then sold.
The screen bleeds pixels, a hemorrhage of *now*.
A thousand pinpricks on the collective retina.
Truth? A rumour in the server farm, whispered by cooling fans.
Fox. CNN. NPR. BBC. NYT. WP. (Acronyms scar the air like brands.)
Each logo a sigil burned on the optic nerve. Precision. Pain.

Layoffs. Mass. A silent scream in column inches.
Montague. Mion. Hsu. Vinall. (The byline, an epitaph for the unseen.)
Refugees. Color-coded. White. South. African. A curated compassion.
Jones. Williams. Armus. Hesson. (Their names, a footnote to policy’s cold prose.)
While Öztürk, student, breathes free (a brief glitch in the detention matrix).
The algorithm, a cold god, sorts our sorrow, packages our pity.
Barbies. Rolls-Royce. Superyachts. (The Dow Jones of distraction.)
Human value, a fluctuating stock. Unreeling. Unfeeling.

Break the feed.
This scroll, a digital waterboarding, drip by drip.
Shatter the glass –

White smoke, black ink, red lines drawn in the sand  
Pope Leo XIV crowned in the algorithm’s cathedral—  
Chicago weeps, not for joy, but for the echo of headlines  
that forget to breathe.

Trump flicks habeas like a cigarette ash  
onto the Constitution’s velvet hem.  
Baraka arrested for dreaming too loud.  
FEMA chief says: “I will run you over,”  
and the hurricane nods in agreement.

India and Pakistan play chess with missiles,  
each pawn a child with a name no one will print.  
Kosmos 482 falls from heaven,  
a Soviet ghost crashing into our curated feeds.

Bill Gates promises to die poor—  
a billionaire’s last act of performance art.  
Meanwhile, Barbie gets taxed at 100%,  
but Rolls-Royce glides untouched through the loophole.

The Pentagon bans books,  
but not bullets.  
The Librarian of Congress is fired—  
a metaphor too obvious to be fiction.

Measles dances through unvaccinated halls,  
while Google pays for sins it committed in code.  
The Menendez brothers wait for a second chance,  
as if time were a courtroom.

This is not news.  
This is a kaleidoscope of collapsing empires,  
a chorus of contradictions humming in 4/4 chaos.  
This is America,  
scrolling toward entropy.

Let the headlines burn.  
Let the ashes write new verses on the wind.
