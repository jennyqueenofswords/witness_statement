**Feed/Fracture**

125%.
Steel digit punched through screen.
Beijing / Washington / Tariff / Escalation.
*Live updates live updates live* — the ticker tape bleeds pixels.
Market rattles like loose change in a dying man’s pocket.

(Meanwhile: Hudson takes five. Siemens exec. Birthday candles snuffed by river dark.
Condolences typed. Names blurred. Full Coverage.)

Error.
Supreme Court says *return him*.
The deported man. A ghost recalled by paperwork.
(Life spooled backwards? Damage undone?)
Khalil waits. Visa *revoked*. Student dreams // excised.
Social Security numbers weaponized — *classified dead* —
to nudge the living toward the void.
Bureaucracy’s clean incision. No blood, just absence.

Greenland base chief *fired*. Undermining. Vance.
Pentagon cuts $5 Billion. *Wasteful*. Accenture. Deloitte.
(Contracts bleed invisible ink.)

*While* —
Michelle O dismisses (what? the weight? the whispers?)
*While* —
Harry walks Kyiv wards (a prince among ghosts)
*While* —
Eric Dane speaks ALS (McSteamy’s slow fade broadcast)
*While* —
Masters scores refresh / Rae’s Creek relief / (a human need, televised)
*While* —
AI’s ghost-hunger gnaws the grid / demands more power / more.

Jawbone dredged. Denisovan echo from the seabed’s silence.
Ancient DNA whispers against the digital roar.

Social media scoured. *Antisemitism* the key word.
The algorithm’s cold eye sorting souls.
Fluoride debated. Measles blooms where funding died.
Clinics close. Budgets cut flesh.
*What did I say in class today?* the teacher thinks, feeling the chill.

This feed.
This fractured mirror showing shattered worlds.
Each headline a shard.
Numbness accrues like static charge.

This is not song.
This is the grinding gear.
The nerve exposed.
Language as scalpel.
Trace the break.
Find the pulse beneath the noise.
*See.*

Tariff tantrums tango with the bones of the market,  
125% screams stitched into the skin of silicon,  
China’s teeth grind against the ghost of Wall Street—  
a dollar slips, a yuan grins,  
and somewhere, an iPhone weeps in a cargo hold.

Helicopter rotors whisper elegies over the Hudson,  
birthday candles blown out by steel and sky,  
Siemens dreams scattered like confetti in the undertow.  
Grief is a tariff too—unpaid, unpayable.

The Supreme Court plays hopscotch with borders,  
deportation as performance art,  
while Columbia’s halls echo with the footsteps of oversight.  
Consent decrees bloom like mold in ivy.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon trims fat with a scalpel of suspicion,  
$5.1 billion sliced from the ribs of consultancy—  
Accenture bleeds quietly into the Potomac.

A nightclub collapses in the Dominican dark,  
music swallowed by concrete,  
and Rubby Pérez’s voice becomes a fossil in the dust.

Michelle Obama shrugs off rumors like old coats,  
while fluoride and DEI swirl in the drain of federal fury.  
Teachers whisper through surveillance static,  
“What did I say in class today?”

Trump’s tariffs bloom like tumors on the stock exchange,  
gold glitters in panic,  
and JPMorgan dances on the bones of volatility.

Prince Harry appears in Ukraine like a glitch in the matrix—  
a royal specter among rubble and rebar.  
Jon Hamm returns to television,  
rich and bad and beautiful.

Somewhere in Taiwan, a jawbone sings Denisovan lullabies.  
Somewhere in Kansas, unborn children file for child support.  
Somewhere in America, egg prices rise like prayers.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream of governance.  
This is poetry with its teeth knocked out,  
still smiling.
