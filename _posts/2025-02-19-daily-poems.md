**Echo Chamber (Executive Order)**

The screen flickers, a face contorts,
a nation fractured,
re-sorted.

Ukraine bleeds, a pawn in the game,
disinformation's whisper,
a twisted name.

(Zelenskyy, a ghost in the machine,
truth drowned out,
a silent scream.)

Approval ratings, a downward slide,
economic anxieties,
nowhere to hide.

IVF, a bargaining chip, a life defined,
by executive order,
a womb confined.

Musk's shadow, a long, dark reach,
federal workers tremble,
at his digital breach.

(Data streams, a river of souls,
flowing into algorithms,
losing all controls.)

Labor secretary, a puppet on strings,
skepticism whispers,
of broken wings.

Adams, a mayor in the crosshairs,
corruption charges,
political snares.

Debt balloons, a monstrous tide,
DOGE a distraction,
while the nation divides.

(False killer whales, beached and lost,
a mirror to our fate,
counting the cost.)

Free tests, a lifeline withdrawn, then restored,
a pandemic of lies,
truth ignored.

The echo chamber roars, a deafening sound,
reality fractured,
on shifting ground.

*****  
Steel-lunged specters howl through the wires,  
Trumpets of disinformation, gilded in static,  
Ukraine trembles, a marionette in the hands of ghosts,  
while the desert whispers deals in oil-slick tongues.  

Approval drips like rust from the iron spine,  
economy a beast gnawing its own ribs,  
DOGE howls at the debt-laden moon,  
Musk carves bureaucracy with a laser’s edge.  

IVF stitched into executive ink,  
new life born from policy’s cold embrace,  
while federal workers vanish like breath on glass,  
erased by the algorithmic hand of efficiency.  

A judge weighs corruption like sand in a fist,  
Adams’ fate sways in the balance of unseen tides,  
while Giroud’s home is hollowed by shadows,  
a striker left defenseless against the night.  

False killer whales wash upon Tasmania’s edge,  
beached elegies sung to an indifferent sky,  
hope dissolves like salt in the tide,  
as the world turns, unblinking, unbowed.  

Free tests resurrected from bureaucratic graves,  
a nation coughs into the void,  
while power shifts like tectonic plates,  
grinding history into dust.
