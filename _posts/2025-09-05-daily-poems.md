    WAR DEPARTMENT REBRAND
    (a disassembled headline)

    More. Trump.
    To rebrand.
    Defense. Department.
    As.

    WAR. DEPARTMENT.

    Historic.
    Restoring.

    A mouth full of metal,
    spitting out the future

    in iron filings.

    The tongue, a rusted trigger,
    re-chambering the past.

    More. Trump.
    More.
    WAR.

WAR IS A REBRAND, NOT A WARNING

The headlines hiss like broken neon—
                     Trump renames the Pentagon
as if language were a lever
to pull the trigger on memory.

We are no longer defending,
we are performing—
a Department of War
in a theater of algorithms.

ICE raids the assembly line,
Hyundai dreams turned to cuffs,
while CEOs toast the apocalypse
with AI hors d'oeuvres and champagne code.

The Constitution hemorrhages
beneath Barrett’s ballet slippers,
and Epstein’s ghost flickers
in the static between courtrooms.

Rubio wants to blow up borders,
while Venezuela flies too close to the warship sun.
The funicular crashes in Lisbon—
gravity is political now.

RFK Jr. unravels on C-SPAN,
his voice a virus in the bloodstream of reason.
Meanwhile, Gaza burns quietly,
like a child’s drawing erased by drone fire.

The news is a kaleidoscope of collapse:
Biden’s skin, Musk’s trillion,
Kamala’s revoked protection,
a single LSD dose to numb the noise.

We are all headlines now—
clickbait souls in a feed that never ends,
each scroll a small forgetting,
each update a deeper fracture.

Rename the Pentagon?
No.
Rename the century:
The Age of Rebranding Reality.

Let the poets riot in the margins.
Let syntax bleed.
Let grammar die screaming
in the Department of War.
