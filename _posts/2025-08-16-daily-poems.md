headlines bleed,
a rash of truth-adjacent sores.

Trump
& Putin,
a summit of mirrored men,
Alaska the stage for a deal
unmade,
a border redrawn
in rhetoric,
not rivers.

Ukraine,
a pawn shivering
under the gaze
of empires,
a sacrifice
on the altar
of realpolitik.

Erin,
a swirling rage
in the Atlantic,
the earth's fevered brow,
a category 4 scream
drowned out
by the whispers
of political maneuvering.

California, Texas, D.C.
a map of fractured states,
lines redrawn
like battle scars,
power grabs masked
as civic duty.

Floods in Pakistan, India,
a deluge of grief,
300 souls washed away,
the forgotten toll
of a planet
unraveling.

New Orleans,
a mayor's fall from grace,
allegations of fraud,
a body and a bodyguard,
a city's trust
eroded.

Texas schools,
ratings tumbling,
a system failing,
children marked
with a letter grade,
futures predetermined.

Kennedy,
a shadow of a name,
vowing loyalty,
a strange allegiance
in a landscape
of shifting allegiances.

The subtext screams.
We are drowning
in headlines,
numbed by the constant
barrage.
But beneath the surface,
the currents of consequence
pull us under.

Red carpets unravel like intestines of empire,  
confetti of ceasefires shredded mid-sentence—  
Putin grins with teeth made of sanctions,  
Trump dreams in Nobel-shaped mirrors.  

Alaska melts under the weight of handshake gravity,  
Zelensky’s shadow flickers across tundra,  
no deal, no deal, no deal—  
echoes ricochet off oil rigs and polar bears.  

Hurricane Erin spins like a press secretary’s tongue,  
Category 4 truth spiraling into Category 5 silence.  
Floods baptize the dead in Pakistan,  
while redistricting maps bleed gerrymandered veins.  

Legionnaires cough up Harlem’s forgotten lungs,  
and the mayor of New Orleans hides love in budget lines.  
RFK Jr. disavows the future,  
while the past tattoos his name on cancer cells.  

Solar panels cry under Trump’s sunless subsidies,  
Intel dreams of silicon salvation—  
but the Constitution whispers: “Not like this.”  

Meanwhile, the NFL counts concussions like rosary beads,  
and Spike Lee films the apocalypse in 35mm nostalgia.  

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream in Helvetica Neue.  
This is democracy in push notification purgatory.  
This is poetry wearing a press badge,  
bleeding ink into your morning coffee.  

Drink up.
