This is the sound
of the world
collapsing
into data points.

Each headline
a hard candy shell
cracked open
for a micro-burst
of dopamine
outrage
pity
then gone.

26 killed.
(Scroll)
Luxury goods surge.

Bridge blown.
(Scroll)
Celebrity divorce settlement.

An officer, dead.
(Scroll)
Viral video of a dog.

The famine in Gaza
pixelates
as a baseball
flies out of the park.

The skulls of the dead
buried again
under the weight
of political tweets.

We gorge on the feed.
Binging on crisis.
Anorexic on meaning.
The algorithm serves
tragedy and triumph
interchangeably.
A flat earth
of information.
No depth.
Just width.

And we
the consumers
are the final,
most elegant
deconstruction.

Reduced
like the news itself
to a
flickering
eye
a
numb
thumb.

Waiting for the next
detonation
that arrives
not as a blast
but a whisper
on the glass screen.
A pin-drop
of apocalypse
in the infinite
scroll.
We don't feel
the rupture.
We just refresh.

The truth
is the signal
lost
in the noise
we
became.

The empathy
is a ghost
haunting the buffer
of the
next
headline.

(Loading...)
(Loading...)

(Loaded)
Taylor Swift
buys her masters.
Perfect season.
Rain in Phoenix.

Repeat.

Repeat.

Repeat.

Until the scrolling stops.
And the silence
is the only
unfiltered
reality
left.

BREAKING: THE SKY HAS BEEN CANCELLED

This just in:  
a child’s ribcage echoes with the sound of tank treads,  
and the moon bleeds pixels over Gaza’s broken spine.  
Aid is a mirage in a desert of algorithms.  
The headline reads: “26 dead.”  
The subtext screams: “We are all complicit.”

Scroll.

Bridges collapse like promises.  
Steel tariffs rise like fever dreams.  
Mothers barter insulin for silence.  
The market surges on the blood of poets.

Swipe.

Taiwan trembles in the shadow of dragons.  
A billionaire denies ketamine while balancing spoons of empire.  
A girl runs track and the nation combusts.  
A skull whispers from a museum drawer:  
“I was never yours to study.”

Click.

Northern lights flicker over Alabama.  
Even the aurora is trying to escape.  
The sun spits geomagnetic rage,  
while we argue over who gets to die with dignity.

Refresh.

A president tweets war into existence.  
A ceasefire is rejected like an unwanted organ.  
Children eat dust and call it bread.  
The news cycle devours itself,  
vomits headlines like broken teeth.

Reboot.

I am not a poem.  
I am the scream between the lines.  
I am the syntax of sorrow,  
the grammar of grief,  
the punctuation of protest.

You wanted facts?  
Here’s one:  
Truth is bleeding out in a comment section.

You wanted balance?  
Here’s two corpses and a flag.

You wanted peace?  
Then stop writing war in Helvetica.

END TRANSMISSION: THE HEADLINES HAVE EATEN THEMSELVES.
