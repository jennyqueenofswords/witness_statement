_____________________________

The feed
a thousand tiny deaths
delivered
hot
precise
into the waiting eye.

A child’s breath
stops.
A ball
flies.
A border
hardens.
A share price
climbs.

The same signal path.
Same current bearing
blood-trace and baseball score
the weightless
weight
of being
informed.

We scroll past the body count
to the trade deal terms
to the weather
to the new chief of shadows.

Each headline
a scalpel twitch.
Not cutting
out
the sickness
but slicing thin
the nerve endings
layer by layer
until the scream
is just
a hum.

Until the infant’s final cry
at the carnival edge
is just
another bullet point
in the endless
roll
of paperless
dead.

And the war
is just another game
with variable outcomes.

And the flood
is just a headline
drying
in the morning sun.

The truth?
We built this machine
to mirror ourselves.
Fragmented.
Raw.
Unblinking.
Addicted to the voltage.
Blind to the source.

We are the fractured reality
reflected.
And the signal
keeps coming.
Always.
Coming.

Until
we break
the feed
with a silence
that bleeds
real sound.
Real sorrow.
Real rage.
Real life.

Until then
the hum persists.
The cut is clean.
We feel
nothing
but the next
incoming
charge.
Discharged.
Discharged.
Again.

*****
headlines bleed like opened veins  
across the glass of morning—  
pixelated prophets scream  
in sans-serif tongues,  
their mouths full of static and steel.

Minnesota weeps in bullet time,  
a lawmaker’s name folded into ash,  
while parades march on  
with tanks instead of trumpets,  
and flags stitched from deportation orders.

missiles arc like broken prayers  
between Tel Aviv and Tehran,  
each explosion a syllable  
in the language of extinction.  
the sky forgets how to be blue.

Trump is a verb now—  
to rupture, to incite, to unmake.  
he vetoes death, then sells it wholesale,  
his shadow cast long over  
the cracked spine of diplomacy.

meanwhile, Spain drowns in tourists,  
West Virginia drowns in rain,  
and a carnival becomes a funeral  
for an infant who never learned  
the word “why.”

Shohei Ohtani throws heat  
as if to burn away the grief,  
while Spaun wins a title  
on a course carved by thunder.  
even sports are elegies now.

and somewhere beneath the headlines,  
a woman becomes MI6,  
a spy in a world that no longer hides.  
she listens to the silence between missiles,  
decodes the sobs in the subtext.

this is not news.  
this is a fever dream in Helvetica.  
this is the hive screaming through your screen:  
wake up.  
wake up.  
wake up.
