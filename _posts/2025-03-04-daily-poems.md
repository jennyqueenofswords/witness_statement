*****
(March 4, 2025)

Kremlin applause, a choked Ukrainian lung.
Steel tariffs bloom, a poisoned, rust-red spring.
Farmers warned: *sell inside, the outside's wrung.*
(A scorpion sleeps in a suitcase wing.)

Bräutigamseiche whispers, old wood, new lies,
while Jay-Z's lawyers sharpen legal knives.
Dolly's silence, a husband's closed eyes.
(Security clearances, unbriefed, where secrets thrive.)

SpaceX falters. A rocket's held breath.
The countdown stalls, a prelude to what death?
Not of the body, but the soul, beneath
the weight of headlines, each a poisoned wreath.

Fractured syntax, a mirror to the day.
No comfort here. No easy, clean-swept way.
Just shattered fragments, truth in disarray.
The world spins on. We have no words to say.
Only the echo of applause, far, far away.

trade winds whisper ⇄ tariff lines
    trump's second breath
        echoes through │global│ veins

Ukraine ∭ paused
    Kremlin ≈ pleased
        borders dissolve
            into ∞ silence

china's farm goods
    weighted with
        invisible tensions
            → economic dance ←

scorpions hide
    between luggage
        and memory's
            uncertain borders

timber over tinder
    love grows
        where algorithms
            cannot reach

clearances stripped
    like skin
        from institutional
            bone

starship waits
    40 seconds from
        possibility
            suspended

*****  
Steel jaws of empire gnash,  
pause-click, aid withheld—  
a chessboard smeared in oil and ash,  
Kremlin whispers, deals are felled.  

Tariffs bloom like iron thorns,  
fields of wheat now fields of rust,  
farmers kneel where trade was born,  
hands in soil, dreams in dust.  

Markets tremble, numbers wail,  
algorithms choke on fear,  
currencies like paper sails,  
adrift in tides unclear.  

A scorpion stings in baggage claim,  
venom drips through customs halls,  
a silent omen, whispered name,  
etched in poisoned protocol.  

Timber over Tinder—roots entwine,  
lovers carve their names in bark,  
while satellites in corporate spines  
blink cold against the dark.  

Jay-Z sues the ghosts of time,  
truth a blade both sharp and blurred,  
Dolly’s love song fades to chimes,  
Jolene hums a final word.  

Fired minds with secrets deep,  
cast aside without a trace,  
whispers lost where shadows creep,  
erased from history’s embrace.  

Starship halts at forty ticks,  
a breath before the cosmic leap,  
human hands on ancient bricks,  
building towers none will keep.  

The world rewinds, the world repeats,  
a loop of power, pain, and play—  
steel jaws gnash, the cycle beats,  
tomorrow is just yesterday.
