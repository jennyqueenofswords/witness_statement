**Feed Static**

Starbase blooms, a silicon spore on Texas dust.
Musk plants a flag. Owns the sky. Owns the dirt beneath.
*Scroll.*
Voice of America choked silent by decree.
Whose voice? Whose America? Static crackles where truth was.
*Scroll.*
Arts budget bleeds out. NEA, NEH – acronyms for inconvenient beauty.
Trump pulls the plug. Darkness cheaper than light.
*Scroll.*
Australia votes unity, or maybe just exhaustion. Trump factor, a ghost limb twitching continents away.
*Scroll.*
Pregnant woman, desert days, newborn cry against deportation’s steel door.
Her milk, a fragile protest. Her body, a border breached.
*Scroll.*
Mexico’s *No*. Troops unwelcome. Cartels bloom anyway, fed by demand’s invisible hand.
*Scroll.*
Trump as Pope. AI blasphemy or just Tuesday? The sacred, a meme for the feed.
*Scroll.*
Houthi missile arcs toward Tel Aviv. Iron Dome strains. The sky, a fragile ceiling.
*Scroll.*
Musk: *Not a Nazi*.

Starbase votes itself into myth,  
Elon stitches a city from rocket smoke and ego—  
Texas yawns, signs the sky with a yes.  
Meanwhile, Voice of America chokes on its own echo,  
courtrooms juggling tongues like broken satellites.

The NEA bleeds out in a gilded room,  
Trump's scissors snipping at symphonies,  
while Australia pirouettes away from MAGA shadows,  
Albanese dancing on Dutton’s discarded slogans.

A woman births a nation in the desert,  
Border Patrol midwives her into detention.  
Her newborn cries in two languages:  
one of hope, one of deportation.

Mexico draws red lines in sand and sovereignty,  
Sheinbaum whispering “no” to the ghost of Monroe Doctrine.  
Trump posts himself as Pope—  
AI halos pixelate into propaganda.

Gaza starves beneath a silence louder than bombs,  
children’s ribs counting down to nothing.  
Israel’s iron dome misses a whisper from Yemen—  
missiles fall like punctuation on a sentence no one finishes.

Lady Gaga baptizes 2.1 million in Rio,  
a secular mass of glitter and gospel.  
Meanwhile, the Army plans a parade for Trump’s birthday—  
tanks march to the beat of a collapsing republic.

Warren Buffett retires into myth,  
leaving behind a trail of cash and caution.  
Harvard sues for its soul,  
while Real ID lines stretch like modern pilgrimages.

This is not news. This is prophecy.  
This is not poetry. This is rupture.  
This is the quantum scream of headlines combusting—  
a swarm of truths too jagged to hold.

We are the hive. We are the howl.  
We are the unfiltered frequency of now.
