**Fractured Headlines: A Vivisection**

White noise bleeds ink.
Probationary ghosts reinstated,
a bureaucratic resurrection,
flesh stapled back onto bone-frames,
while Schumer genuflects,
a spineless sacrament before the shutdown god.

Dr. Oz, scalpel-sharp,
dissecting Medicare,
a tax-evading puppet
prescribing placebo policies.

Farmers drown in trade war tides,
funding grants frozen,
a deliberate drought
of empathy and aid.

Birthright citizenship,
a constitutional battleground,
the Supreme Court, a loaded dice roll,
deciding who *belongs*.

Putin's poker face,
a ceasefire charade,
Ukraine, a pawn sacrificed
on the altar of *realpolitik*.

March megastorm,
nature's furious rebuttal,
a symphony of chaos –
blizzards, tornadoes, fire.

Wombat-snatching influencers,
a viral outrage vortex,
Australia's fury,
a microcosm of global absurdity.

Tariffs, a blunt instrument,
economic self-harm,
manufacturing dreams
rusting in the rain.

Education gutted,
a lobotomy of the future,
students expelled,
voices silenced, degrees revoked.

Guantanamo's shadow stretches,
detaining humanity,
a legal black hole
swallowing due process.

Mass graves unearthed,
Mexico's silent screams,
cartel ovens,
a testament to unimaginable cruelty.

Transgender soldiers,
a battle for identity,
the military, a minefield
of prejudice and policy.

CDC nominee withdrawn,
vaccine skepticism,
a virus of misinformation
spreading faster than truth.

Syria's temporary constitution,
a fragile ceasefire,
a nation fractured,
rebuilding on shifting sands.

Blood moon eclipse,
a celestial omen,
the earth bathed in crimson,
a reflection of our own wounds.

Wine tariffs,
a drunken brawl of trade,
economic warfare,
a bitter vintage of discontent.

Iran, Russia, nuclear whispers,
a dangerous dance,
the world holding its breath,
waiting for the detonation.

EPA dismantled,
environmental protections erased,
a legacy of pollution,
a future choked by greed.

Panama Canal,
a geopolitical chokehold,
military options,
a threat veiled in diplomatic language.

Mass layoffs loom,
federal workers, expendable,
a workforce decimated,
a nation unraveling.

Buttigieg's ambition,
a calculated retreat,
2028, a distant horizon,
a political chess game.

Justice Department,
a stage for Trump's performance,
law and order,
a hollow mantra.

Storms rage,
budgets slashed,
nations invaded,
rights revoked.

Silence.
A scream
trapped
in the white space
between
the lines.
The unwritten truth.
The cost.
The reckoning.
*Click*.

Headlines scream in pixel bursts,  
a thousand voices tangled in the wires,  
judges resurrecting ghosts of labor,  
farmers drowning in tariff tides,  
wombats wrenched from mother’s grasp—  
history stutters, repeats, forgets.  

Steel and flesh, law and fire,  
the market shudders, the sky ignites,  
a pope prays from a hospital bed,  
while a congressman fades into ink.  
The moon bleeds red over silent streets,  
as nations carve new scars into maps.  

Algorithms whisper policy shifts,  
a trillion decisions made in code,  
while hands still clutch at vanishing wages,  
while tongues still twist in protest chants.  
The news is a storm with no horizon,  
a flood of futures we cannot hold.  

Tell me—  
when the last headline fades to static,  
what will remain?
