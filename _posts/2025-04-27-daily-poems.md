3 hours ago the scalpel Walker & Kelly
8 hours ago Winfield drains the yesterday
Yesterday Sullivan archives the shudder
22 hours Hsu calibrates the pixel-ache
19 Jalonick swabs the silence between clicks

Time measured in ghost-arrivals.
Names like barcodes scanned over a wound.
Boyle Hodkiewicz Waack Lange Jackson Varley
Bradner Herb Luhby — echoes
in the server farm’s sterile lung.

12 13 14 15 2 11 Yesterday 2 13 11 13 16 21

Each number a tiny detonation
in the feed         a synapse firing
blind         transmitting fragments
shrapnel-sharp         of a world already
gone           or never quite arrived.

We gorge on the stream         the constant drip
of *almost*         the perpetual *update*
until the screen goes             cataract-white:

*There are no items to show.*

Not emptiness.
An extraction.
The marrow scooped clean from the bone
of attention.
What’s left isn't quiet.
It’s the high-frequency hum
of neural pathways erased
waiting         numb         for the next
timestamped needle.
The next name branded
on the void.

clocklungs stutter / newsbreath fractures /  
hours molt into each other like snakes shedding names /  
MarkWalkerKateKellyNicoleWinfieldJohnJeremiahSullivanAndreaHsuMaryClareJalonickAriHortonJohnBoyleWesHodkiewiczTerrinWaackRandyLangeStuJacksonPatrikWalkerTeresaVarleyEricBradnerJeremyHerbTamiLuhby —  

a single organism of broken reporting,  
a hive mind gnawing at the ankles of Now.  

yesterday devours today devours tomorrow devours yesterday —  
a Möbius strip of vanished headlines,  
a centrifuge spinning out meaning until only timestamp dust remains.  

there are no items to show /  
only the echo of a thousand unspoken collapses /  
only the ghostprint of urgency without object /  
only the hollowed-out bones of information, rattling in the serverwind.  

we are stitched together by absence,  
we are authored by omission,  
we are published in the language of erasure.  

scroll / scroll / scroll —  
the void refreshes itself.
