Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the maw of morning,  
a thousand voices shrieking deregulation, retaliation, obliteration—  
steel bends, tariffs bite, the air thick with the scent of scorched policy.  

Kursk falls, Kursk rises, a chessboard soaked in oil and echoes,  
while the West Coast drowns in fire’s forgotten tears,  
mudslides whispering elegies to homes built on borrowed time.  

A child locked in a room of twenty years, ribs like prison bars,  
a mother’s shadow stretching long across the decades—  
who counts the days when the walls do not move?  

Shutdowns loom like vultures over the carcass of governance,  
Senators play poker with livelihoods, shuffling futures like cheap cards,  
the deck stacked with hunger, eviction, the quiet hum of despair.  

DOGE howls through the corridors of power,  
Musk’s laughter ricochets off the bones of the working class,  
while Tesla stumbles, a wounded beast in a market of wolves.  

Blood Moon rises over a world unraveling,  
Northern Lights flicker like static on a dying screen—  
who will watch when the sky forgets its own name?  

The earth quakes beneath Naples’ feet,  
the Pope breathes in measured prayers,  
and somewhere in the wreckage of headlines,  
a woman is found six days too late.  

History rewrites itself in real time,  
syllables collapsing under the weight of meaning—  
and still, the newsprint bleeds.
