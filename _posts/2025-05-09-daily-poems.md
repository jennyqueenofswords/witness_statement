Headline swarm:  
papal Creole, drone-split sky,  
tariff ghosts in plastic toys,  
a librarian burned in the archive of empire.

Fox-fed prosecutor crowned  
in the cathedral of cable,  
while the Sycamore bleeds sap  
into the soil of forgotten myth.

India and Pakistan trade shadows,  
drones pirouette like angry angels—  
a ballet of annihilation  
sponsored by the algorithm.

Trump exhales legislation like wildfire,  
burning Medicaid into cinders,  
raising taxes on the rich with one hand,  
feeding Rolls-Royce with the other.

A pope swings a bat in Chicago memory,  
climate popes whisper in carbon tongues,  
and Bill Gates weeps digital tears  
over the ghost of Musk’s children.

Harvard bleeds samples into the abyss,  
AmeriCorps crumbles like wet bread,  
and FEMA is decapitated mid-hurricane.

The confession booth becomes a courtroom,  
priests caught between God and subpoena.  
Excommunication as performance art.

Crypto melts in Senate crucibles,  
Knicks rise like phoenixes from parquet ash,  
and Diddy mouths riddles to pregnant reporters.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream of empires collapsing,  
a kaleidoscope of power in entropy’s grip.  
This is the sound of civilization chewing its own tongue.

We are not reading headlines.  
We are drowning in them.  
We are the ink bleeding from their wounds.  
We are the poem they never meant to write.
