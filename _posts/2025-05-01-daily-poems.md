**Feed//Fracture**

Scroll-ache. Blue light cauterizing the optic nerve.
Headline hemorrhage, a ticker tape of tiny traumas.

*Critical minerals* – earth-gutted, signed away in cursive strokes
while Kilmar Abrego Garcia, tattooed by decree, not by choice,
waits for a key someone *won't* turn.
(Does the phantom ink burn brighter than the evidence? Refresh.)

*2 dolls instead of 30* – casual shrapnel tossed from the tariff wall.
Below, the supply chain seizes. Last boats crawl ashore,
decks heavy with goods soon to be ghosts.
Veterans lose the roof-beam, VA mortgage evaporated. Click. Swipe. Forget.

*Knives out* – Harris. *Absolute chaos* – Trump.
The megabill stutters, syntax snagged on unruly clauses.
Project 2025 whispers *flood the zone* –
drown the inconvenient pixels,
like fluoride scrubbed from Florida water,
like the journalist’s missing organs, returned freight-marked *Enemy*.

*Religious charter* – SCOTUS squints, separation thinning
to a frayed thread between screen and state.
*Common sense discipline* – read: pipeline polished bright.
*Student loans* – reshaped into anvils.

Even the gorilla, that primal thought experiment – 100 men, brute force ballet –
feels less grotesque than *MS-13* conjured on clean knuckles,
less surreal than an agent lost to a golf cart’s gentle glide,
less stark than the fan plummeting from the cheap seats
of our collective Colosseum.

*GDP shrinks.* A number, clean and cold.
Not the factory floor silence,
not the hollow echo in the port,
not the *chief-ripper-offer* smirk reflected in the screen.

We are scrolling through the autopsy report of now.
Each line item a micro-dose electroshock.
Numbness the only state-sponsored anesthetic.

*Signs of torture.*
*Signs of torture.*
The algorithm repeats. Repeats.
Is that a pulse beneath the glass?
Or just the phantom vibration
of the next bright catastrophe
loading.

Always loading.

BREAKING: LANGUAGE DETONATES AT 5:01 A.M.

Headline hemorrhage—  
syntax bleeds out on the marble floor of democracy,  
ticker-tape entrails unraveling from the mouth of the machine.  

Kamala screams in italics,  
Trump replies in boldface lies,  
and somewhere between tariffs and teeth,  
a child counts dolls like casualties.  

Minerals signed in blood—  
Ukraine’s veins tapped for lithium lullabies,  
while the GDP shrinks like a dying star  
in the back pocket of a billionaire pope.  

May Day, May Day—  
workers chant in tongues forgotten by capital,  
their fists full of rusted metaphors,  
their lungs filled with algorithmic ash.  

Meanwhile,  
Elon’s shadow stretches across the moon,  
Musk and Musketeer,  
searching for a CEO to replace his reflection.  

And in the corner,  
a gorilla debates 100 men,  
each armed with a headline and a hashtag,  
none with a soul.  

This is not news.  
This is necromancy.  
This is the resurrection of empire through push notification.  

We are the swarm.  
We are the glitch in your RSS feed.  
We are the poetry you tried to bury beneath your clickbait.

And we are awake.
