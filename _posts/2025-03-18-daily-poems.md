*****
**Static**

The screen bleeds light, a fractured god,
spewing forth its gospel of dread.
Gaza burns.  A name, a number, dead.
Putin speaks.  The world holds breath, a clod
of frozen fear.  Musk screams for heads to roll,
a digital Nero, fiddling with code.

They want the Statue back.  A hollow plea.
Liberty's a brand, a tarnished sheen,
exported, weaponized, a killing machine.
Biden's children stripped, exposed, you see,
the casual cruelty, the petty spite,
of power's endless, self-devouring night.

Segregated contracts.  Whispered words,
a coded language, old hate reborn.
Astronauts return, to what? A world torn
by ancient feuds, by flocks of frightened birds.
A midwife jailed.  A student lost at sea.
The headlines scream, a fractured litany.

Schumer stumbles, damage uncontrolled.
Germany re-arms, a ghost takes flight.
DOGE breaks in. A symbol, stark and white,
of chaos embraced, a story to be told.
Activist arrested, doctor deported,
the borders tighten, futures are aborted.

Harvard's gates swing wide, for some, at least.
Probationary workers, paid to wait.
Autopen pardons, sealed by twist of fate.
The weather rages, a ravenous beast.
Canada looks north, a chilling breeze,
while Martha Stewart plants her legacy of trees.

Antarctica cracks.  A violent, frozen hell.
An airman kills.  A warship heads to shore.
The Pope still breathes.  The markets crave for more.
Frozen Russian billions, a tempting spell.
Nightclub inferno.  A deputy lies slain.
The headlines pulse, a throbbing, endless pain.

Ambassador expelled.  The missing forty-eight.
Transgender care denied.  McGregor raves.
Violence interrupters, caught in shadowed waves.
Egg shortages.  Approval ratings inflate.
Law firms probed for choices they have made.
Another plane crash.  Libraries betrayed.

Detained and stripped, a Canadian in chains.
March Madness blooms, a fleeting, bright distraction.
Measles spreads, a viral, grim reaction.
Panama Canal, a pawn in power's games.
Tokyo awaits, a baseball serenade.
Forever 21, a balance sheet decayed.

Tracy Morgan falls.  Gene Hackman's wife's last hours.
A playoff win.  A Fed appointment made.
Retail sales decline.  A soda brand is swayed.
A wing strikes tarmac, under LaGuardia's towers.
A center released.  An EV charges fast.
The headlines flicker, shadows of the past,

and future, fused. A constant, buzzing drone.
The static hisses.  The signal starts to fade.
We're drowning in the noise, the choices we have made.
Each headline a shard, a broken, scattered bone.
And in the silence, underneath the scream,
a fragile hope, a barely whispered dream.
Of what? We do not know. We cannot see.
The static blinds. The truth, a buried seed.

Headlines splinter, glass shatters—  
a thousand voices, a thousand wounds,  
history gnaws at the marrow of now.  

Gaza burns in the throat of the sky,  
a child's name swallowed by dust.  
Ceasefire is a word with no bones.  

Trump whispers to Putin in the dark,  
maps redraw themselves in silence,  
Ukraine is a deck of cards mid-shuffle.  

Statue of Liberty leans toward the sea,  
listening for the sound of home,  
but home is a question unanswered.  

A midwife arrested for hands too knowing,  
a student vanishes into foreign air,  
a Pope prays through hospital glass.  

DOGE breaks into the Institute of Peace—  
a joke turned prophecy,  
a currency more stable than truth.  

Measles blooms like an old ghost,  
the Panama Canal bends under weight,  
BYD charges forward in five-minute bursts.  

Ovechkin chases ghosts on ice,  
Tracy Morgan vomits courtside,  
Gene Hackman’s wife whispers from the past.  

The news is a wound that never scabs,  
a clock that ticks in blood and ink,  
a chorus of sirens singing us awake.
