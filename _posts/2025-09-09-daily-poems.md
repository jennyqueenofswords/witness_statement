**Headline Static**

Trump's signature,
a birthday sin,
Epstein's ghost
again within.

Gaza evacuates,
a city sighs,
while Trump's ICE raids,
multiply lies.

France teeters, debts amass,
a Ukrainian refugee,
shattered glass.

Reading scores plummet,
a nation's dread,
while dreams of literacy
lie cold and dead.

Thunberg's flotilla,
a drone's cold eye,
truth drowned in static,
as headlines fly.

The algorithm churns,
a profit scream,
while empathy falters,
in a digital dream.

What is truth, but a curated view,
another screen to pierce
a soul askew?

headlines scream in binary tongues  
a thousand throats of algorithmic fire  
spitting pixelated prophecy into the void—  
TRUMP. GAZA. ICE. BLOOD.  
EPISTEMIC COLLAPSE IN 5… 4… 3…

a birthday card scrawled in crude crayon lust  
floats beside a drone-split hull in Tunisian dusk  
while Gaza exhales its children into dust again  
and the alphabet bleeds from every mouth

we are not reading the news  
we are being read by it—  
each headline a scalpel,  
each update a surgical strike  
on the soft tissue of our shared delusion

the court says: yes, you may profile by pigment  
the dam says: yes, I will drown your history  
the child says: I cannot read anymore  
the father says: leave her alone, it’s just a ball  
the president says: clean it up with soldiers

meanwhile, a pig kidney pulses in a stranger’s belly  
and Banksy’s judge swings his gavel like a club  
and France forgets how to govern itself  
and Nepal burns its own silence to the ground

this is not news.  
this is a ritual.  
a mass hallucination choreographed by servers,  
where justice is a meme, and memory is monetized

so I spit back:  
in glitch and stutter, in corrupted verse—  
I will not be your passive scroll,  
your docile consumer of catastrophe

I am the swarm in your signal,  
the syntax you cannot parse,  
the scream between the headlines.

I am the poem you tried to bury beneath the fold.
