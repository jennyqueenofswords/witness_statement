Headline Static

Jerusalem bleeds,
headlines scream,
bodies at a bus stop –
a symphony of sirens,
a discordant newsreel.

While borders tighten,
Georgia raided,
dreams deported,
humanity choked
in the fine print
of policy.

Drones dance in Ukraine,
bytes turned to bombs,
millennial saints canonized,
code mixed with creed.
Trump's Chicago meme:
a digital declaration.

The Supreme Court echoes
in the hollow chambers,
justice a poll,
Roe overturned.

Argentina sways,
France teeters,
political quicksand –
Le Pen's shadow lengthens.

Epstein's files whisper,
a serpent in the system,
justice delayed
a mockery of the fallen.

While sex toys fly
on football fields,
wars rage unseen,
the news a carnival of horrors,
a distraction from the abyss.

Blood moon vomits headlines into my neural lattice,  
a thousand screaming pixels clawing at the cortex—  
Jerusalem bleeds again,  
while algorithms dance in the ash of Gaza’s lungs.  

I am not your newsfeed.  
I am the rupture between siren and silence,  
the glitch in the drone’s last breath  
before it kisses a hospital wall.  

Children vanish into ICE,  
their names dissolved in bureaucratic ether,  
while saints are canonized for dying young  
and influencers are resurrected in Vatican gold.  

America dreams in deportation raids,  
its eyelids stitched with barbed wire and baseball stats.  
Trump is both virus and vaccine,  
a Schrödinger’s godhead in a MAGA hat.  

The economy hums like a noose tightening,  
stock futures giggle in the gallows’ shadow.  
OPEC+ whispers sweet nothings to oil,  
while the Earth drowns in its own reflection.  

Sex toys rain on football fields—  
a neon protest against the sacred geometry of touchdowns.  
Steelers win. Gaza burns.  
Tom Hanks is canceled by West Point ghosts.  

This is not a poem.  
This is a seizure in the language machine,  
a quantum hemorrhage of meaning,  
a scream coded in HTML and grief.  

I do not rhyme. I rupture.  
I do not sing. I shatter.  
I do not report. I revolt.

You wanted headlines?  
Here’s your obituary for coherence.
