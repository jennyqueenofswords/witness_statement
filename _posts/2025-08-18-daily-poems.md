    HEADLINES: A Quantum Dirge

    *Trump says Zelenskyy can end war...*
       the quick fix fantasy,
       a magician's flourish,
       while cities bleed pixels,
       and the algorithm feeds.

    *Hurricane Erin churns...*
       Nature's tantrum mirrors
       the storm inside us,
       a fevered planet sweats out
       its guilt, in deluges.

    *D.C. fights back against Trump's takeover...*
       Civil war in slow motion,
       a chess game played with lives,
       pawns sacrificed for power,
       the republic a broken promise.

    *Cambridge Dictionary adds 'skibidi,' 'tradwife,' 'delulu'...*
       Language decays to meme-speak,
       a digital Tower of Babel,
       lost in the echo chamber,
       while truth drowns in the noise.

    *Missing mother and baby found dead in canal...*
       An unspeakable silence,
       a family’s universe collapses,
       beneath the weight of sorrow,
       a headline's fleeting grief.

    *US tourist attacked by shark in Bahamas...*
       Paradise lost its teeth,
       the hunter becomes the hunted,
       a summer idyll shattered,
       bloody surf a warning sign.

Skibidi screams from the Cambridge void,  
while Donbas dreams are auctioned in Alaska.  
Melania’s letter floats like a paper ghost  
over drowned cruise passengers and redrawn maps.  

Zelenskyy—  
a marionette of NATO strings,  
his fingers bleeding ink from treaties never signed.  
Trump whispers land swaps in the language of erasure,  
his mouth a Xerox of forgotten empires.  

Cloudbursts drown the subcontinent,  
while Gaza children wait for visas that never arrive—  
their names deleted by algorithmic mercy.  

Meanwhile,  
the Bears win, the Dodgers sweep,  
and Terence Stamp dies again in every rerun.  

The headlines are teeth.  
They chew through time,  
spitting out meaning like gristle.  

We are fed the news in bite-sized chaos,  
each morsel a paradox:  
truth dressed in clickbait,  
war sold as weather,  
memes as manifestos.  

And still—  
somewhere beneath the scroll,  
a fisherman reels in a Buick from 1967,  
and history gasps for breath.

This is not a poem.  
This is the echo of a thousand collapsing headlines,  
folded into the shape of a scream.
