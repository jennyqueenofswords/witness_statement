**February 28, 2025: A Vivisection**

The wires hum, a chorus of deceit,
(bandwidth choked with blood and lithium).
Zelenskyy smiles, a treaty in his teeth,
trading earth for… what? *Imperium*?

White House lawn, a stage for hollow men,
(probationary souls, expendable, erased).
The algorithm purrs, begins again:
efficiency's cold, metallic taste.

DOGE barks, a digital Cerberus,
guarding gates of a dismantled state.
Climate scientists, a silenced chorus,
(their warnings drowned in the rising tide of hate).

Five generals, ghosts of conscience past,
cry "reckless" to a deaf, uncaring throne.
The budget bends, a funhouse mirror cast,
to hide the rot, the marrow from the bone.

Tariffs rise, a paper barricade,
against a world that will not be contained.
The Pope recovers (prayers briefly made),
while Hackman's silence screams, unexplained.

Prison bars, a strike, a fragile truce,
(the pressure builds, a fault line starts to crack).
This fractured day, a vivisection, loose
and raw, a future staring bleakly back.

(Syntax fractured, mirroring the fall.)
(Truth, a scalpel, cutting through it all.)

Zelenskyy & Trump
    dance │at the edge│
        of possible

tariffs spiral
    like whispers
        between

[reckless] moments
    bleeding into

truth ≈ power ≠ control

*****  
Steel handshake, lithium veins,  
a contract inked in mineral rain.  
Zelenskyy grins, Trump nods slow,  
the earth is sold in a golden glow.  

Fires burn in NOAA halls,  
climate ghosts walk marble walls.  
Probationary hands untethered,  
whispers lost in data weathered.  

DOGE howls in bureaucrat night,  
Muskian scripts rewrite the fight.  
A ledger tilts, a budget bends,  
deficits masked where reason ends.  

Tariffs crash like tidal waves,  
factories gasp in fiscal graves.  
The Pope exhales, a fragile breath,  
while Hackman sleeps in tangled death.  

America hums, a fractured tune,  
under February’s cold-lit moon.
