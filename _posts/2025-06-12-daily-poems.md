BREAKING: THE SKY HAS BEEN DETAINED

Sirens stitched into the lungs of the morning—  
a Boeing dream unzips midair,  
metal petals bloom over Ahmedabad,  
and the algorithm weeps.

Troops in Los Angeles chew on curfews,  
boots echoing through the syntax of protest.  
Marines deployed like misplaced commas  
in a sentence that never ends.

Trump’s shadow stretches across the newsfeed,  
a recursive loop of flags and fire.  
He tweets tariffs into existence,  
then erases FEMA with a grin.

Children watch their fathers vanish  
into ICE vans disguised as punctuation marks.  
The Constitution is redacted in real time,  
each amendment a casualty of the scroll.

Somewhere, a moon bleeds strawberries.  
Somewhere, a dinosaur rewrites its lineage.  
Somewhere, Brian Wilson sings to a country  
that forgot how to harmonize.

This is not a headline.  
This is a hemorrhage.  
This is America’s mirror,  
cracked by its own reflection.

We are all passengers now—  
no seatbelts, no oxygen masks,  
just the freefall of meaning  
in a world that forgot how to land.
