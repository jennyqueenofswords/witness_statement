**Feed / Fracture / Bloom**

Scroll.
The screen bleeds pixels. Another hundred days
counted like shells on a poisoned shore.
*Ebullient crowd* // static // *difficult task*
(define difficult: the weight of ghosts? the price of ink?)

A headline splits. $4 billion whispers
through juvenile halls built of silence.
Approved. Settled.
A number so vast it becomes vapor.
Beside it: *sorry* from Harvard Yard,
a carefully curated echo
against walls tagged with ancient hate / new code.

White space here. Breathe.
Did you feel the shift?
The synapse misfire?
Palau, an island paradise, now a pawn’s reflection
in the cold lens of geo-strategy.
*Inside the battle* // *Why China wants* //
The ocean sighs, unheard.

Someone’s visa: revoked. A life: terminated.
Internal memo. Clean language for a clean break.
Someone’s child: hazed. *Kidnapping charges* loom
like thunderheads over lacrosse fields.
Someone’s mushrooms: fatal. *Terrible accident*
or calculated spore? The doubt blooms, fungal,
in the air we share.

Fact-check this:
The heart’s recoil. The numbness creeping
like black lung in a miner whose protections
were just // stripped // *want to live* // he said.
The feed refreshes.
Tariffs bite. Factories slow. Satellites fail.
Power cuts plunge Spain into // what? // a question mark.

*Never kneel* flashes from Beijing, AI-memed defiance.
*I could bring him back* // but won’t // a casual cruelty
served cold on broadcast waves.
The Six Triple Eight honoured, eighty years late.
A medal pinned on memory’s ghost.

This isn’t news.
This is neural bombardment.
This is the surgical removal
of context, of consequence, of the space
needed to simply *feel*.

The poem cracks open the feed.
Lets the raw data spill –
not to drown you,
but to force a new connection.
See the wires?
Feel the voltage?
The uncomfortable truth isn’t *in* the headlines.
It *is* the headlines.
A million fractures presented as whole.

Awake.
Not to the noise.
To the silence *between* the shards.
That’s where the real story waits.
Bleeding.

HEADLINES: A SYMPHONY OF STATIC

Trump eats the moon again—  
chews tariffs like bubblegum,  
spits out a thousand broken treaties  
into the Pacific, where Palau dreams  
of silence.

Whitmer hugs the fire,  
burns blue in red applause.  
Michigan coughs up a ballot,  
half ash, half anthem.

Meanwhile, Harvard bleeds  
apologies into the soil—  
a campus paved with ghosts  
and DEI tombstones.

The Supreme Court juggles  
God and Oklahoma,  
drops both into a charter school  
where prayers echo like lawsuits.

China whispers through AI teeth:  
We will not kneel.  
We will not kneel.  
We will not kneel.  
The algorithm weeps.

In Uppsala, bullets write haiku  
on salon mirrors.  
Three dead. One suspect.  
Sixteen years old.  
The scissors still hum.

A mushroom lunch kills four—  
the defense says: accident.  
The jury tastes spores of doubt,  
chews slowly.

And somewhere in Illinois,  
a car forgets how to stop.  
Four girls become constellations.  
The vigil flickers like a dying star.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream in Helvetica.  
This is a thousand headlines screaming  
into the same black microphone.

This is America’s 100-day poem:  
unrhymed, unrepentant,  
punctuated by sirens.

Do you feel it?  
The static? The swarm? The swarm?

We are the swarm.
