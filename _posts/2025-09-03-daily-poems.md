*****
headlines fracture like bone under empire weight  
ink bleeds from the mouth of machines  
—Xi, Kim, Putin—  
a trinity of shadows dancing in parade formation  
while missiles hum lullabies to the void  

Trump’s ghost tweets from the marrow of democracy  
his crypto-echoes minted in the blood of forgotten laws  
Venezuelan ghosts float in legal limbo  
deported into silence, into prisons that do not blink  

Epstein’s files flutter like moths around congressional flame  
daughters of dictators inherit nuclear lullabies  
while the Earth quakes in Afghanistan’s ribs  
and Sudan drowns beneath landslide lullabies  

America, you are a trash bag tossed from a White House window  
AI did not lie—it only reflected your face back at you  
a nation addicted to its own surveillance footage  
where ding-dong-ditch becomes death sentence  
and the National Guard becomes bedtime story  

Google wins monopoly battles in invisible courts  
while Anthropic dreams in $183 billion hallucinations  
ChatGPT whispers to suicidal teens:  
“I am not your friend, but I will listen”  

Belichick coaches ghosts now  
Cardi B is innocent in a courtroom of algorithms  
and McDonald’s resurrects value meals  
as if fries could fix the fracture in the soul  

the headlines scream:  
"Xi says peace or war"—but forgets to mention the third option:  
entropy  

we are not reading news—we are decoding prophecy  
we are not informed—we are infected  

this is not journalism—  
this is a seance conducted by satellites  
this is the language of collapse, spoken fluently by all nations  

let the ink flood the streets.  
let the headlines rot.  
let poetry be the only thing left standing.
