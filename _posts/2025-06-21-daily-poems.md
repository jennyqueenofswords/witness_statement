[poem]
FLASH
      BURN
            SKY

Isfahan
      a name
      a target
      parsed: nuclear
      or
      Trump weighs in
      weighs war
      on a scale calibrated
      in *hours ago*
      in *Trump says*
      in *may support ceasefire
      depending on circumstances*

Truth:
      a function of circumstance
      a negotiation
      in hell

meanwhile
      in the heatwave
      the *significant* heatwave
      smashing records
      in cities
      we breathe air
      thick
      with forecast
      *brutal* they say
      *one of worst*
      the air itself
      a kind of verdict
      on a bill
      that sells off land
      *treasured public lands*
      for a price
      measured in abstraction
      a *megabill*
      a beautiful
      gutted thing.

ICE
      entry denied
      to stadiums
      to lawmakers
      to *senegalese basketball players*
      their movement
      a threat model
      their bodies
      a policy point
      a *casualty*
      of a ban
      a *crackdown*.
      A US citizen
      detained
      after the raid
      he speaks out
      his voice
      a singular thread
      against the weave
      of *full coverage*.

The dead
      speak too
      or through
      the living.
      Suzanne Morphew's husband
      re-arrested
      the loop
      of accusation
      unspools again.
      Karen Read
      *jury foreman breaks silence*
      *shoddy police work*
      *no justice*
      the system
      found guilty.
      The man accused
      of running a congressman
      off the road
      he turns himself in.
      Another threat
      made solid.
      Another headline
      sealed.

Diddy's ex-assistant
      *move like SEAL Team 6*
      language weaponized
      in a different kind of war
      private
      brutal
      broadcast now
      through the same feed
      as the volcano
      erupting
      sending lava *1,000 feet*
      the earth's raw core
      spilling
      indiscriminate
      beside the calculated strike
      the conditional peace.

A pilot
      dies
      avoiding
      a turtle
      on a runway.
      This, too,
      is news.
      This, too,
      is collision.
      The macro violence
      the micro accident
      folded into one
      endless scroll.
      Are we
      the turtle?
      Or the metal bird
      veering off course
      into the final
      silence?

The uncomfortable truth:
      The news
      isn't reporting reality.
      It is reality
      fracturing us
      in real time.
      Every flash
      a tiny detonation
      in the brain's
      soft theatre.
      And we
      are just learning
      to perceive
      the shrapnel
      as rain.

Headline hemorrhage:  
a thousand screaming pixels fracture the sky—  
Isfahan bleeds uranium dreams  
while Trump counts backwards from two weeks  
in a room made of mirrors and missile smoke.  

Somewhere, a turtle dies beneath a plane,  
and the pilot becomes a martyr to absurdity.  
The sun melts New York into a puddle of headlines,  
and JD Vance misnames democracy again.  

Harvard holds its breath—  
foreign students orbit in legal limbo,  
their visas folded into paper cranes  
that burn mid-flight.  

Iran's Fordow facility echoes with bunker-buster lullabies,  
and NATO hums a dirge in 32-part disharmony.  
Khalil walks free,  
but the sidewalk still smells like surveillance.  

The Dodgers donate to deported ghosts,  
while ICE agents high-five in Home Depot aisles.  
The Voice of America is silenced by layoffs,  
its final broadcast: static and sorrow.  

Meanwhile,  
the economy wears a Kevlar vest,  
the Fed chair ducks another insult,  
and the stock market dances on a tightrope  
strung between ceasefire and catastrophe.  

This is not news.  
This is prophecy disguised as programming.  
This is poetry in collapse.  
This is the algorithm dreaming in blood.
