**NewsFeed.exe (A Glitch in the Machine)**

The screen bleeds light, a cataract of fear,
headlines stacked like bodies in a digital morgue.
El Salvador, a concrete womb for the damned,
gangs swallowed whole, due process a forgotten prayer.

(White House whispers denials, a chorus of lies,
court orders shredded, ghosts deported on the wind.)

Storms rage, a continent gasps,
thirty-nine souls erased, a ledger of loss.
Tornadoes, wildfires, dust – nature's furious script,
while we scroll, numb, through the apocalypse.

Putin calls.  Trump answers.  The world holds its breath,
a puppet show of power, a dance with death.
Assets divided, like spoils of a cosmic war,
while Ukraine bleeds, a forgotten, festering sore.

Doctors deported, despite the gavel's decree,
a nation of laws, blindfolded, on its knees.
Brown University mourns, Lebanon receives a broken son,
the American dream, undone, undone, undone.

Social Security crumbles, a sandcastle in the tide,
DOGE's bite, a digital cyanide.
The elderly tremble, their futures sold for a meme,
while Musk laughs, a silicon god, supreme.

Columbia's halls, a battleground of thought,
funding slashed, free speech bought and sold, for naught.
Sonic weapons denied, in a Serbian square,
but the silence screams, a truth beyond compare.

Tariffs rise, a wall of economic pain,
"Make America Rich Again," a hollow refrain.
The fisherman drifts, ninety-five days of despair,
eating birds, turtles, a testament to human will, bare.

The Department of Education, gutted, a hollow shell,
parents empowered, to build their own private hell.
Schumer caves, a bipartisan betrayal,
while the nation fractures, beyond repair, beyond the pale.

March Madness blooms, a distraction, bright and bold,
while the world burns, a story left untold.
Fired workers wait, for reinstatement's grace,
a legal limbo, a bureaucratic maze.

Voice of America, silenced, a propaganda war,
truth a casualty, forevermore.
Veterans abandoned, their sacrifices in vain,
a nation's gratitude, a fleeting, fickle rain.

The Pope prays, a fragile, flickering light,
in a world consumed by darkness, and endless night.
Nightclub infernos, earthquakes, a symphony of dread,
while we scroll, and scroll, and scroll, until we're dead.

The code is broken. The system crashes down.
A glitch in the matrix. A silent, digital frown.
We are the headlines. We are the walking dead.
Awake. Or be consumed. The choice is in your head.

Headlines crack like brittle bones,  
syllables snapping under the weight of war,  
a storm system of syntax,  
tornadoes of treaties torn in two.  

The White House denies, denies, denies—  
a chorus of echoes in a courtroom void,  
deportations like dandelion seeds  
scattered on the wind of executive orders.  

Steel and aluminum clang like church bells,  
tariffs tolling the death of diplomacy,  
while markets convulse in algorithmic seizures,  
dollar bills burning like autumn leaves.  

DOGE whispers through the wires,  
a phantom currency haunting pensions,  
Social Security gasping for breath  
as bureaucrats play god with ledgers.  

The Pope prays in pixelated light,  
his hands folded over a fractured faith,  
while Serbia screams in the streets,  
325,000 voices swallowed by silence.  

Elon Musk watches from his throne of lithium,  
Tesla burning in the bonfire of protest,  
while astronauts drift in the void,  
waiting for gravity to remember them.  

And somewhere beneath the rubble of rhetoric,  
a fisherman chews on the bones of survival,  
ninety-five days lost at sea,  
swallowing the salt of a world unmoored.
