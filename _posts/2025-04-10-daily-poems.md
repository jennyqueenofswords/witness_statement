**Feed/Fracture**

Ticker tape of collapsing veins:
*Tariff pause.* (Breathe?) *Stocks tumble.* Reality bites back.
Ninety days held hostage by a tweet.
*Retreat.* *Balk.* *Delay.*
The budget, a bone gnawed by hard-liners in back rooms.

Then the flesh-trade, sanitized:
*Swap.* Ballerina for… what? £39 buys freedom, or a cage.
*300 visas revoked.* Purge. Deported. Mistake?
*Gulag Archipelago* typed casual on a Tuesday.
Judges rein in judges rein in power rein in… static.

*Shower heads.* Make them GREAT. Acceptable pressure.
A Fact Sheet dissects a leaker’s risk
while concrete dust settles slow
on 21 bodies. *Hope fades.*
Pedro Martinez waits by the phone.
Somewhere between Beijing’s arsenal
and Ken Doll LeBron
a roof gave way.

Did you feel it?

*Monumental Split.* World economy on edge.
Facebook sold security for server space.
Whistleblower silenced / speaks now / to Congress.
MS-13 leader: Arrested! Charged! Wait—
*Case withdrawn.* Deported? No. *Dismissed.*
Justice a jump-cut, erratic signal.

This scroll, a digital avalanche burying the pulse.
Each headline a shard, reflecting fragments.
*Buy now!* Trump tips the market. Insider tremor?
Or just noise. Always the noise.
Walmart vows low prices. Oil retreats.
A judge shoots her boyfriend sleeping.
An author shot by police.
Someone struggles home from hostage hell.
Real ID deadline looms.

What frequency vibrates beneath
the Dow’s jagged gasp,
the border’s razor wire song,
the algorithm deciding who stays, who goes,
whose tragedy merits pixels?

This feed, a fracture
we mistake
for the whole picture.
A surgical numbness
delivered fresh
each minute.
Awake?
Or just scrolling
through the wreckage.

Tariff tongues taste like rusted futures,  
Wall Street weeps in algorithmic Morse—  
a thousand blinking eyes,  
each a collapsed cathedral of speculation.  

Pause.  
The EU mirrors the mirror,  
a 90-day breath held in bureaucratic lungs,  
while the stock market forgets how to exhale.  

Trump signs the wind again—  
executive orders like origami grenades,  
unfolding into showerheads,  
into deportations,  
into carbon ghosts fleeing cargo ships.  

Visa revocations fall like cherry blossoms  
in a spring of suspicion.  
Students vanish from Michigan dorms,  
erased by the ink of invisible borders.  

A roof collapses in the Dominican night—  
Pedro Martinez counts the missing stars.  
Octavio Dotel becomes a name carved in concrete grief.  

Prisoners swap hemispheres like baseball cards.  
Ksenia pirouettes back into freedom,  
Arthur exhales in a language he forgot.  

The court gavel echoes like a shotgun—  
a judge shoots her lover in his sleep,  
justice wears mascara and a trembling hand.  

Meanwhile, LeBron becomes plastic immortality,  
a Kenbassador of consumer dreams,  
while Luka is ejected for whispering too loud to ghosts.  

RFK Jr. dances with measles and metaphors,  
his voice a vaccine of confusion.  

And Walmart smiles through clenched teeth,  
promising low prices on high anxiety.  

This is not news.  
This is a kaleidoscope of collapsing empires,  
a fever dream of headlines stitched into skin.  

This is America’s poem:  
written in tariffs,  
punctuated by deportations,  
edited by executive order,  
and printed on the back of a foreclosure notice.

Welcome to the scroll that never ends.  
Welcome to the scream beneath the ticker tape.
