[poem]
FIELD REPORT: POST-REALITY STREAM

Victory. Declared.
Before the ash settled,
the next list finalized.
Executions. In the wake. Twelve-day war.
Spying, they claim.
A brutal pulse. Internal.
Intelligence,
damaged. Satellite blur.
Obliterated, they say.
Another says, fake.
The lie a bunker-buster
falling silent

                        on Congress, suddenly

                                                limited vision.
News of
Trump. Trump. Trump.
Cuts proposed. Kill FEMA. Starve PBS.
Job Corps / Lifeline / SEVERED. Judge says HOLD.
Union wall / REBUILT. Order blocked.
Power / shifts / daily dust.
A heat dome settles, brutal, not just weather.
The forecast: scorch. Relief points FAIL.

Kenya.
Protests. Youth pulse.
EIGHT KILLED.
SIXTEEN.
By police.

Bezos / Venice.
Star-studded.
Inequality / HIGHLIGHTED.
While crypto
Eyes the mortgage map.
Nvidia, record high.
The market breathes thin air.

Diddy trial / nears end.
AI wins / Authors LOSE.
Copyright / broken script.
Shell eyes BP? No. YES. No.
A rumour’s phantom limb.

Bond Director / F1 film / Michelin stars.
The scroll
relentless.
A smoking engine / Mid-air / Smooth Landing / They SAY.

Mississippi / executes / longest-serving / death row.
1976 murder.
The rhythm / measured / final / disconnect.

RFK Jr. / Unpicks the needle.
Vaccine panel / Disrupts norms.
Chaos / predicted / Against the hum
Of forgotten grants / suddenly / PAUSED. Then / UNPAUSED?

Venezuela spy chief / Pleads / GUILTY.
Narco-terrorism.
The ugly roots / exposed / then buried fast.

Iran. Claimed Victory.
The myth / SHATTERED / another says.
How Israel / Failed / another says.
Negotiate.
Forget obliteration.
But the feed moves on.
The next headline
Splits the screen.
A sports trade. A doge meme.
A piece of land / on the block / Then / NOT.
Another river
of soundbite / image / data point
Washing over / smoothing down
The sharp edge / of what was true
Just moments ago.
We are here.
Submerged.
In the fractured light.

Ayatollah pixels flicker in the algorithmic dusk,  
a Supreme Leader rendered in 4K contradiction—  
victory declared in the syntax of smoke,  
while satellites weep infrared over craters of silence.  

Nuclear dreams dissolve in the heat shimmer  
of post-truth deserts—  
a bunker buster blooms like a steel lotus,  
and the data bleeds out of the sand.  

Trump’s ghost fingers the redacted margins,  
whispers “obliterated” into the ears of senators  
who chew on classified crumbs  
like rats in a marble mausoleum.  

Meanwhile, Iran’s internal organs twitch—  
executions as punctuation,  
mass arrests as enjambment,  
the poem of power written in disappearing ink.  

And somewhere beneath the headlines,  
a child draws a mushroom cloud with crayons,  
calls it “home,”  
calls it “God,”  
calls it “tomorrow.”  

The world scrolls on.
