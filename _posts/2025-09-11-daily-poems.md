Fractured Newsfeed Requiem

Kirk falls, a spark,
ignites the tinder,
politics bleeding out,
smeared on the screen.

Harris turns,
Biden's question mark
a brand new book
but what does it even MEAN?

Mandelson, Epstein's shadow,
fired, a stain spreading
across oceans,
reputations incinerated.

Qatar attack,
a strike undermining
credibility,
enemies hunted
in shadows of achievement.

Atlanta raid,
handcuffs loosened,
impact considered,
investment weighed
in scales of fear.

Poland,
Article 4 invoked,
drones,
a Kremlin plot
to kill believability.

Charlotte,
a Ukrainian life shattered,
random knife
through the American dream.

Evergreen,
suspect dead,
the week just begun,
community shaken,
violence continues.

Epstein files blocked,
signature questioned,
Senate ambushed,
truth buried
beneath protocol.

Transgender boy,
bathroom fight ends,
Supreme Court weighs
scales
of identity.

Apple's $2000 phone,
luxury distraction,
Abbott's THC order,
a MAGA legal weed.

Fuel company pollution,
courtroom implications,
heat waves traced
to profit margins.

Rock on Mars,
clearest sign yet,
of what we desperately
want to see
staring back.

Inflation creeps,
challenges mounting,
jobs data questioned,
truth fractured,
shattered.

BREAKING: THE SKY HAS BEEN SHOT

Charlie Kirk bleeds pixels in Utah—
a headline hemorrhage, a nation
gargling its own algorithms.

Kamala's book burns Biden's shadow
while Mandelson drowns in Epstein's ink—
the monarchy sips scandal like tea.

Trump strikes boats, files, Mars—
everywhere a flashpoint,
everywhere a name with teeth.

The news is a wound that never clots.

A Mars rock whispers: I remember life.
The Supreme Court rules in bathroom echoes.
A gas tanker explodes like a forgotten promise.

We scroll through carnage like weather reports.

Mamdani surges. Elon slips. The Fed twitches.
Children protest gerrymanders with crayons.
The hurricane season forgets how to scream.

And still, the headlines multiply—
a hydra of grief, of spectacle,
of data dressed as prophecy.

We are fed the world in bullet points,
and still we starve for meaning.

Let the poem be a riot in the feed.
Let syntax collapse like a regime.
Let language bleed truth in tongues unspoken.

This is not a poem.
This is a siren.
This is a scream
with a search bar.

Refresh.
Reload.
Repeat.
