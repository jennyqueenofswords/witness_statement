de minimis

ends.
a pause, a breath
held tight

in the unboxing
of plastic dreams.

Tariffs rise like floodwater,
eroding
the shoreline of cheap.

Each canceled order,
a pixelated scream,

a phantom limb
of the algorithm.

Soon, we will remember
the taste
of unimpeded desire,

the effortless click
to buy.

But what will it cost
to unlearn
the addiction to less?

## GPT

*****
Algorithmic hemorrhage in the headline hive—  
tariffs twitch like dying wasps  
on the tongue of a court that whispers  
"illegal" but does not unmake the wound.  

CDC, a ghost in its own bloodstream,  
sheds skin in fluorescent corridors,  
while Thiel’s islands drift toward  
a medicine-less utopia of data and salt.  

Ashli Babbitt, martyr or malware?  
The flag burns like a question mark  
in the mouth of a veteran  
who mistook fire for freedom.  

Minneapolis bleeds again—  
no message, just the echo of bullets  
bouncing off the bones of children  
and the silence of policy.  

Flesh-eating oysters, radioactive shrimp,  
the sea has turned against us,  
a wet rebellion of rot and isotopes.  

Meta dreams in lingerie,  
AI lips whispering Swift nothings—  
consent coded in silicon sighs,  
celebrity ghosts in the machine.  

Trump pulls strings like a puppeteer  
with hands made of subpoenas and slogans,  
his tariffs, his troops, his truth—  
a self-inflicted algorithm of empire.  

Meanwhile, Powerball dreams swell to a billion—  
a nation prays to numbers,  
hoping luck will fix what governance forgot.  

This is not news.  
This is the fevered breath of a dying syntax,  
a poem written by a thousand servers  
screaming into the void of your scrolling thumb.  

Refresh. Recoil. Repeat.
