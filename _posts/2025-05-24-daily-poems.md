*****
Mahmoud cradles his son like a ceasefire,  
flesh against flesh in the courtroom’s cold breath—  
a lullaby smothered by paperwork and policy.  
The gavel does not weep.

Kyiv dreams in sirens,  
missiles etch lullabies into the sky,  
and drones whisper through blackout veins—  
a ballet of shrapnel and silence.

The Pentagon locks its lips,  
press passes shredded like old truths.  
National security tastes like ink and iron,  
like secrets buried beneath marble floors.

A man wakes to a ship in his garden—  
steel leviathan beached on suburban grass.  
He waters it with disbelief,  
wonders if it will bloom into war.

Trump signs executive orders with a golden pen,  
each stroke a scalpel carving at the body politic.  
He calls it beautiful.  
The poor call it famine.

Gaza waits with open mouths and closed borders.  
Children draw food in the sand.  
Aid is a rumor,  
hope a contraband emotion.

The Constitution trembles in its glass case—  
habeas corpus mispronounced into oblivion.  
Freedom now comes with footnotes,  
and the footnotes are redacted.

Billy Joel forgets the lyrics to his own brain.  
A nation hums along anyway,  
dancing to the rhythm of denial,  
clapping for the encore of collapse.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream in Helvetica.  
This is a nation sleepwalking through headlines,  
mouths full of algorithms, hearts full of static.

We are all Mahmoud now—  
held for the first time by something we love,  
while the state debates if we deserve breath.  
The gavel does not weep.

But we do.
