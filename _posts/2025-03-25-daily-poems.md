Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the maw of the machine,  
Trump tariffs tangle like vines around the throat of trade,  
deportations drip ink into the veins of the republic,  
a Columbia student sues the sky for mercy,  
but the courtrooms echo only with the sound of closing doors.  

Signal chains unravel, war plans whispered to the wrong ghosts,  
Yemen burns in the margins of a journalist’s inbox,  
while Greenland shivers beneath the weight of interference,  
and Venezuela is sold in increments of policy and oil.  

A judge mutters that even Nazis were kissed softer by history,  
as Venezuelans are shuffled like playing cards across borders,  
ICE sweeps Massachusetts clean of names and faces,  
while a mother is left alone with fifty-four hungry dogs.  

The moonies dissolve in Tokyo’s legal acid,  
while Louisiana’s maps redraw the color of democracy,  
and Ukraine counts its wounded in the language of hollow peace.  

DNA spills from bankrupt servers, auctioned in strands of ancestry,  
Samsung mourns its fallen titan, Tesla flinches at BYD’s shadow,  
and somewhere in California, a woman is strangled by love.  

The news is a storm with no eye,  
a flood with no shore,  
a fire with no rain.  

And still, the headlines keep coming.
