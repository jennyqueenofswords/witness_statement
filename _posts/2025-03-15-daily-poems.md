**SCUM.EXE**

The newsfeed bleeds, a digital hemorrhage.
Trump, the verb, the wound, the orange-stained bandage
ripped off, revealing bone, the gristle of power
unsheathed. He calls them *scum*, the legal hour
hands ticking backwards.  Justice, blindfolded, bleeds
from the ears.  The headlines scream, plant poisoned seeds:

*Shutdown averted.* (But the soul shuts down daily.)
*Tornado outbreak.* (The news cycle, a whirling, deadly
funnel of fear.) *DEI crackdown.* (Divide. Erase. Ignite.)
*Travel ban.* (Walls rise higher than any flight
of reason.) *Columbia University.* (Knowledge, a threat.)
*Arlington Cemetery.* (History, rewritten, a debt
unpaid to the fallen, the silenced, the erased.)

The White House, a black hole, sucking light, replaced
by pronouncements, executive orders, a fist
clenched around the throat of dissent.  *ISIS chief killed.*
(Another ghost, another victory claimed, the war
unending.) *Hamas.* *Gaza.* The open sore
of the world, festering.  *Hostages.*  *Ceasefire.* Lies
layered on lies, a skyscraper built on sighs.

And then, the mundane horror, the slow decay:
*Missing student.* *Extermination camp.* The price we pay
for apathy, for scrolling past the pain.
*Law firms targeted.* The system, rigged again.
*Dr. Oz.* (Snake oil salesman, elevated.) *EPA.*
(The air we breathe, a bargaining chip.) *Gaza, they say,
will be relocated.* (To where? To dust?)

SpaceX launches.  A billionaire's hollow lust
for escape. Greenland rejects the orange hand.
The earth groans.  *Blood moon.*  A sign we understand
but ignore.  The algorithms feed the beast,
a constant stream of outrage, a poisoned feast.

*Consumer sentiment tumbles.* (No surprise.)
*Measles.* (The past returns, a plague in disguise.)
*Burning plane.* *Eaglet missing.*  The fragile things
break first.  The silence screams. The future sings
a dirge.  And somewhere, a poet, fractured, raw,
tries to make sense of the chaos, the gaping maw
of this unraveling.  The code is broken.  The screen
flickers.  The truth, a virus, unseen, obscene,
infects the system.  Reboot.  Reboot.  Reboot.
The scum rises.  The truth takes root.

*****  
Headlines fracture, pixelated screams,  
a thousand voices, none redeemed.  
Trump spits venom, courts ignite,  
truth dissolves in neon light.  

Storms unravel, skies convulse,  
tornadoes waltz with shattered pulse.  
Ceasefires dangle, brittle thread,  
while bodies count the words unsaid.  

Eggs inflate, gold ascends,  
markets tremble, logic bends.  
Measles whispers, past returns,  
history flickers, fever burns.  

Druze cross borders, decades torn,  
Greenland scoffs at power worn.  
Justice hunts with sharpened teeth,  
while silence festers underneath.  

A pope recovers, eagles fall,  
a nation stumbles through the sprawl.  
Headlines churn, a restless seaâ€”  
who writes the script? Not you. Not me.
