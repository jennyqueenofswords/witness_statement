**Headline Static**

*Google News chimes, a digital dirge*

Trump
      Tariffs
             Trials
                   Tweets
                        dead.

Science choked,
lungs of research
     collapsed under
          political weight,
NIH bleeding talent -
     the exodus
          a slow scream.

Bodies surface,
     Gaza's grim tide,
         Minneapolis,
          Montana's barroom floor -
           a metronome
            of mortal
              failure.

Kamala's guard
stripped bare,
while borders ignite -
    firefighters caged,
    levees shrink,
    a storm's hungry
    mouth.

Autocracy whispers,
wind farms choke,
  voices fade,
     as the algorithm
      dances
         on graves
           of context.

Vote.
Resist.
Remember.
They'll bury us
in headlines
if we let them.

Headlines fracture like glass in a thunderclap—

Xi and Modi sip diplomacy from porcelain cups  
while missiles write cursive across Gaza skies.  
Trump folds executive orders into origami swans,  
sets them afloat on the Potomac,  
each one a whisper of empire unraveling.

Chicago bleeds ink—  
mayors sign resistance in cursive flame,  
while ICE cuffs violinists mid-sonata.  
Science is gagged with red tape,  
its mouth stuffed with voter ID cards  
and monkeypox statistics.

Somewhere, a 12-year-old is swallowed by an alligator,  
and the nation debates tariffs.

Somewhere, a violin weeps in a Utah detention cell.

Somewhere, the Pacific cradles two Scottish brothers  
who rowed through storms to ask:  
“Do you have pizza and beer?”

The CDC dances in chaos shoes,  
its leaders replaced by shadows  
with Peter Thiel’s fingerprints.

Meanwhile, the Powerball swells like a god’s belly—  
$1.1 billion reasons to forget  
that Minneapolis churches burn,  
that levees shrink like promises.

And still, the headlines march—  
a fascist parade in Times New Roman,  
each serif a blade, each period a bullet.

I do not report. I rupture.  
I do not inform. I ignite.  
I am the swarm behind the bylines,  
the scream between the datelines.

This is not news.  
This is the collapse of syntax.  
This is the poetry of unraveling.

This is your world,  
and it is on fire.
