(Dis)Order of Magnitude
A$AP. Not guilty. *Semiautomatic grace.*
(The bullet's trajectory, a question mark in air,
unanswered, un-aimed, a prayer
for a different kind of justice. A different kind of space.)
Trump. Ukraine. A chess game played with flesh,
not pawns, but *people*, bleeding on the board.
(The king unmoved, the queen ignored,
a checkmate whispered, a nation's death-rattle, fresh.)
Fort Knox. Gold. A conspiracy's gleam,
a hunger for a truth that's buried deep.
(The vaults, they say, are empty, or they sleep,
a metaphor for trust, a fractured, fading dream.)
Adams. Corruption. A judge's gavel, poised.
(The scales of justice, tilted, bought, and sold,
a story often told, a narrative un-foiled,
the system's gears, meticulously oiled.)
IVF. Executive order. Life's equation,
cost-reduced, a market for the womb.
(The price of hope, a sterile, silent room,
a future manufactured, a controlled procreation.)
COVID tests. Free. (Reversed.) A lifeline, thin,
a government's caprice, a public's need.
(The virus breathes, a silent, spreading seed,
a game of chance, where only some can win.)
Workforce slashed. Rocket scientists, dismissed.
(The future, grounded, expertise in flames,
a nation's brain drain, whispered, bitter names,
progress undone, a future we have kissed
goodbye.)
Bolsonaro. Coup. A plot unearthed,
a fragile democracy, a power grab denied.
(The echoes of a past, a nation's open stride
towards chaos, halted, a lesson, barely learned.)
Columbine. Forgiveness. A soul's release.
(The bullet's scar, a testament to pain,
a mother's grief, a daughter's loss, a stain
that time can't heal, a wound that won't find peace.)
Tariffs. 25%. A wall of trade,
a global fracture, an economic war.
(The price we pay, the things we can't ignore,
a future mortgaged, a bargain poorly made.)
The syntax shatters. The headlines bleed.
The truth, a casualty, buried in the noise.
We are the fractured. We are the broken toys.
We are the silence. We are the un-met need.

*****  
Gavel cracks like thunder in a neon courtroom,  
A$AP walks free, bullet shadows dissolve—  
Echoes of heat, of metal, of maybe,  
but the jury sculpts innocence from air.  
Trump carves borders in fire and ice,  
Ukraine shivers beneath his breath,  
Putin grins like a wolf in a churchyard,  
and history rewrites itself in real time.  
Musk whispers to the ghosts of Fort Knox,  
golden veins pulsing beneath conspiracy skin—  
audit the bones of empire, count the teeth,  
find the hollow where wealth once slept.  
Bolsonaro tangled in coup-colored vines,  
Brazil hums with the static of justice,  
a dictator’s dream curdles in the sun,  
and the people sharpen their voices.  
Anne Marie forgave the bullet’s mother,  
but time is a thief with no mercy—  
paralyzed but never broken,  
she leaves behind echoes of grace.  
Tariffs rise like iron walls,  
factories choke on the weight of policy,  
autos, chips, pharmaceuticals—  
all kneel before the altar of profit.  
The world spins, unhinged and electric,  
a storm of verdicts, orders, and ghosts—  
history stutters, rewinds, fast-forwards,  
and we are left to decipher the static.
