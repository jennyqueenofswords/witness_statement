## News Cycle Static

The screen flickers, a broken mirror
reflecting fractured states,
each headline a shard
lodged in the collective throat.

*Trump* – National Guard – *Portland*
a phantom limb of division, itching.

*Shutdown* – layoffs – *Trump*
the guillotine of governance,
a slow drip of anxiety
on the working class.

*France* – resigns – *again*
the carousel of power,
spinning faster, meaning less.

*Gaza* – obliteration – *peace talks*
a double-edged blade of hope and horror,
held trembling in unsteady hands.

*Chicago* – Border Patrol – *shoots*
a city bleeding,
the thin blue line blurring
into a wall of separation.

*Everest* – stranded – *snow*
ambition frozen,
a white shroud on hubris.

*Tequila* – heist – *Fieri*
even Flavortown falls prey
to the sticky fingers of desperation.

*Swift* - variant - *Showgirl*
The algorithm sings,
hypnotic and shrill,
while the world burns
just outside the frame.

PORTLAND IS A VERB NOW

Portland is a verb now—  
it riots in the throat of headlines,  
spits pepper mist and court orders  
into the lungs of the republic.

Trump sends shadows,  
but the judge slams the door on ghosts.  
California says:  
Not today, not our children, not your boots.

The National Guard stands at the edge of a dream,  
rifles full of hesitation,  
uniforms stitched with the thread of protest signs.

Meanwhile,  
the French Prime Minister resigns in a whisper,  
and Gaza burns in every language.

A woman is shot in Chicago—  
her blood becomes punctuation  
in a sentence ICE never finished.

The government shuts down like a broken eyelid.  
Emails blame Democrats.  
Emails blame gravity.  
Emails blame the moon.

Somewhere, Guy Fieri’s tequila is hijacked—  
24,000 bottles vanish into the ether,  
like truth in a press briefing.

And Everest weeps under snow.  
And skydivers fall without parachutes.  
And the Pope prays for immigrants  
while drones hum over flotillas.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream of empire.  
This is a nation chewing its own teeth.

This is America,  
broadcast in all caps,  
scrolling endlessly toward oblivion.

Do not refresh.  
Let it crash.
