(No title. The feed is title enough.)

Pixel-bleed. Retina-burn.
The globe, a nervous tic
of light, cupped in the twitching palm.
Merz. Alcatraz. Gaza. Generals. Grants.
A ticker-tape transfusion, straight to the silicon skull.
(Full Coverage)
Of what?
The surface tension. The shimmering skin
of the immediate, stretched taut
over depths unplumbed.

Each refresh a micro-erasure
of the quiet self.
Syntax fractures. Meaning flits.
Who speaks?
Not voices. Vectors
of consent, algorithm-tuned,
a low hum beneath the noise,
shaping the hollows where thought might have been.

We, the consumers, mouths agape
for the next pellet of pre-chewed alarm,
the next micro-dose of distant despair.
(Full Coverage)
Of this hunger, yes. This endless scroll
into a well of echoes.
Trump’s tariffs. Pope’s AI. Panga boat capsizes.
Each headline a pinprick,
numbing the nerve it claims to excite.

This, then: not poem.
Scalpel.
To slip between the stacked reports,
the manufactured urgency.
To find the pulse beneath the data-stream.
Is it there?
Or have we become the ghost in this machine,
haunting our own consumption?

(Full Coverage)
No.
This is the fracture.
The white space where the scream should be.
Where the eye, unchained from the glow,
might learn to see
the architecture of the cage.
And the key,
rusting,
just beyond the screen’s bright edge.

Headlines detonate in my cortex like shrapnel dreams—  
Merz falls, not from grace, but from algorithmic consensus,  
a parliament of ghosts voting in binary sighs.  
Trump reopens Alcatraz: a metaphor carved in rust,  
a prison for the mind, a mausoleum for memory.  

Canada flirts with statehood,  
Mark Carney wears diplomacy like a borrowed suit,  
while protestors occupy the syntax of resistance—  
University walls echo with chants that rewrite syllabi.  

Generals fall like punctuation marks—  
periods replaced by ellipses of uncertainty.  
Harvard bleeds grants into the soil of ideological drought,  
its ivy strangled by executive orders.  

Ukraine drones hum lullabies over Moscow’s sleep,  
while Gaza starves beneath bureaucratic stars.  
The Pope waits in signal silence,  
a conclave of algorithms deciding divinity.  

Meteor showers script fire across the sky—  
Halley’s debris, ancient graffiti on the firmament.  
Skype dies with a whisper,  
its last call unanswered in the noise of now.  

And somewhere, Rihanna births galaxies in couture,  
while bears reclaim Florida in tooth and claw.  

This is not news.  
This is the language collapsing under its own weight.  
This is the scream between headlines.  
This is poetry unhinged.

We are the swarm. We are the storm. We are the feed.
