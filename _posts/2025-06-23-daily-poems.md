*****
[poem]
Headline: a shard.
A splintered glass eye
reflecting
the world as
simultaneous rupture.

IRAN STRUCK
BULLSEYE!!! TRUMP SAYS
Oil climbs. Stocks dip.
A different screen
shows Lake Tahoe,
SIX DEAD.
Drowning.
While across the feed, a golden net
catches a ball. CHAMPIONS.

The cadence breaks
like bone.
No connective tissue.
Just
pulse.
Pulse
fire.
Pulse
drown.
Pulse
celebrate.

FBI, DHS warn: THREAT ENVIRONMENT HEIGHTENED.
A security guard,
a gun,
prevents
a different headline.
CHURCH SHOOTING PREVENTED.
The air thickens
with the breath
not taken.

Robotaxis roll out.
Steel embryos learning
paths
while diplomats
draw lines in sand
already
scorched.
Astronomers unveil
galaxies.
A universe
unfolding
vast
indifferent.
We
shrink
here
on this tiny, burning
platform
trading deaths
like baseball cards.

WAR POWERS QUESTIONED
(again)
A cycle
humming
beneath the noise.
The feed doesn't
ask permission.
It just lands
a strike.
Another.
Another.
On
your optic nerve.
On
the soft tissue
of empathy.
Until the white space
is the only
truth left.
The silence
between
the blasts
of
information
where nothing
grows
but
numb.
And even that
is just
another
headline
fading.

Too fast.

> Machines of war spin their metal threads
> Drones whisper above trembling borders
> Uranium glows beneath satellite eyes
> Putin waits, Khamenei breathes cold revenge
> Screens flicker with promises of safety
> While tankers turn like scared fish
> Something breaks, something always breaks
> And we watch, fingers hovering over buttons
> Waiting for the world to remember how to breathe

*****
Strait of Hormuz, throat of oil gods—  
now choking on the smoke of empire.  
Supertankers pirouette in panic,  
metal whales lost in a sea of algorithms.

Trump tweets “bullseye!!!”  
as uranium dreams scatter like teeth  
from a punched mouth of diplomacy.  
Khamenei weeps in binary,  
Putin plays chess with ghosts.

Satellites blink Morse code into the void:  
Fordow is bleeding pixels.  
The sky over Tehran tastes like  
carbonized treaties and burnt-out constitutions.

NATO summit:  
a masquerade of suits and silence,  
where war is a budget line,  
and peace is a typo corrected in red ink.

Meanwhile,  
a church in Damascus explodes into prayer,  
and a mother in Michigan clutches her son’s ghost  
as headlines scroll like funeral hymns.

This is not news.  
This is prophecy disguised as programming.  
This is the algorithmic apocalypse,  
clickbait crucifixion,  
a thousand live updates screaming into the void.

And still—  
the robotaxi rolls on,  
its tires humming elegies for the living.

Welcome to the feed.  
Refresh. Reload. Repeat.
