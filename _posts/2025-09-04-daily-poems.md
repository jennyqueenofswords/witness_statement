BREAKING: THE SKY HAS BEEN INDICTED

Tariffs tango with time’s torn tongue,  
Trump tweets treaties into tremors—  
Supreme Court shadowboxing with  
a hologram of empire.

RFK Jr. melts in CDC centrifuge,  
his chromosomes rearranged by  
vaccine whispers and viral ghosts.  
The Senate grills him on a spit of science.

Meanwhile, Venezuela burns in  
a pixelated boat strike—  
eleven ghosts swallowed by algorithmic waves,  
Maduro’s sanctuary pixelated into myth.

Harvard bleeds funding from its ivory pores,  
Gorsuch scowls in footnotes,  
while judges whisper dissent into  
the Supreme Court’s shadow-docket void.

Chicago shivers under National Guard rumors,  
Baltimore holds its breath,  
New Orleans becomes the next chess piece—  
a pawn soaked in federal ink.

Lisbon funicular crashes into fate,  
steel bones twisted like syntax,  
a nation mourns in semaphore silence.

Epstein files boil beneath Congress’ skin,  
truth is a virus they can’t vaccinate against.  
Trump calls it AI—  
a digital scapegoat for analog sins.

Kim Jong Un parades his daughter  
through Beijing’s dreamscape—  
a dynasty coded in nuclear lullabies.

Burning Man burns a man.  
Kilauea erupts in lava glyphs.  
Pfizer demands a Nobel for speed.  
Texas sues pills and permits paranoia.

This is not news. This is not poetry.  
This is the bloodstream of a dying language,  
hemorrhaging headlines into the void.

We are the swarm. We are the scream.  
We are the glitch in your feed.  
We are the quantum chorus of collapse.

Refresh again. We dare you.
