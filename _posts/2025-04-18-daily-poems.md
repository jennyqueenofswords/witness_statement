**Feed | Static | Bloom**

(El Salvador handshake :: FSU grass stains :: Ukraine ultimatum :: China trade weeks away)

Scroll.
The pixel drip, relentless IV
feeding fragments, not whole thoughts.
White space here
is the synapse misfiring, the gap
where context used to live.

(Yemen port burns :: 58 :: Houthi media says :: Harvard billions :: Constitutional crisis?)

Scroll faster.
The ticker tape unwinds a shroud woven from Now.
Indictment beside celebrity arrest beside ceasefire rejected.
Each headline a clipped wing, fluttering briefly
before the next digital boot stamps it flat.
Banality blooms bright orange, toxic.

(Birthright held :: ICE hold :: Florida man :: U.S.-born :: Certificate means less than the algorithm's guess)

Scroll slower?
The fractured mirror shows only shards.
Autism report / RFK Jr. missing the point / experts agree /
We are missing the point.
The signal degrades into noise, into us.
Each notification a tiny tremor
along fault lines we pretend aren't there.

(Cable car plunges :: ravine swallows scream :: Puerto Rico dark :: Mars dust holds maybe-life :: Head Start bleeds funding)

Is this processing
or just buffering?
The weight loss pill / the stock plunge / the Medal of Honor / the asylum seeker's smashed window /
Each line item a nerve ending
severed, cauterized by the next alert.
A surgical tenderness applied too late,
to the wrong wound.

(Scroll stops.)

This isn't news.
It's the static discharge of a system overloading.
A million bright distractions paving the road
to collective dissociation.
The form *is* the fracture.
The content: confetti scattered
on the grave of attention.

Wake
up.

The feed
is eating
the world.

BREAKING: the syntax is bleeding again  
in the newsroom cathedral where headlines kneel  
to the algorithmic altar of now.  

Rubio whispers peace into a void shaped like Ukraine,  
while Gaza burns in pixels,  
and Harvard drowns in endowment guilt.  

Trump’s shadow stretches across every paragraph—  
a ghostwriter of policy,  
scribbling deportation orders in invisible ink  
on the backs of citizens  
who forgot their birth certificates at home.  

ICE shatters glass like punctuation marks,  
each crack a stanza in the poem of fear.  

Meanwhile, the Space Force dreams of orbital superiority,  
and Mars exhales carbon secrets  
into the vacuum of forgotten futures.  

A cable car falls in Italy—  
gravity’s cruel haiku.  

Somewhere, a senator shakes hands with a name  
the headlines can’t pronounce without suspicion.  

And in the subtext:  
a woman screams from a tent in Gaza,  
a child counts blackout hours in Puerto Rico,  
a man hijacks a plane with nothing but despair and a blade.  

This is not news.  
This is a symphony of collapse,  
each note tuned to the frequency of empire.  

We are the footnotes of history,  
redacted before we’re written.  

Refresh the page.  
The poem updates itself.
