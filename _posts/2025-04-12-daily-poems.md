**Scroll Burn**

Ninety deals ninety days good luck with that
the market shrugs a tremor in the bonds
(not normal this)
while Khalil waits eligible the stamp descends
a glitch a name erased from *living*
added to the other list the one Social Security keeps
for ghosts who breathe.

The ball is in America’s court says Iran
(whose court holds Abrego Garcia vanished in *error*?)
The border sealed with phantom ink military boots on public land
where maybe dire wolves howl resurrected science
a sideshow while the *real* endangered list
grows names like Mahdi facing the squad
a flashbulb pop in South Carolina dusk.

Headlines bleed pixels:
*Tariffs* a scalpel slicing textiles thin in towns that forgot thread.
*DEI* a dirty word scrubbed from chalkboards funds frozen mid-sentence.
*Visas* revoked like library cards one semester left tough luck kid.
*Climate* research gutted NOAA dismantled showers made *great* again
water pressure the priority not the flood.

Cognitive test passed aced every answer right
while Gaza burns hell on earth the Red Cross whispers
and Batman stalks Westminster Bridge for gamblers
a cartoon justice while real courts weigh resentencing
for brothers decades gone.

Steel folds in Britain law firms cut deals pay up avoid the order
the budget a battlefield conservatives frustrated
inflation jumps consumer dread a plummeting graph
RFK Jr. finds the autism *cause* by September promises promises
like measles vaccine protection waning (false)
like confidentiality the VA can’t guarantee.

A portrait swapped Obama out Trump’s fist raised high
in the Grand Foyer.
A governor won’t run.
A hockey player returns.
A triple-double scored.
The scroll accelerates a blur of proper nouns
a firehose drowning the specific pulse
the single breath caught
in the algorithm’s throat.

This is the feed.
The fractured now.
Read faster.
Forget faster.
Good luck with that.

Trumpets blare in algorithmic tongues,  
tariffs spiral like rusted DNA,  
and the headlines scream in Morse code:  
90 deals in 90 days—  
a fever dream of empire stitched  
with red thread and executive ink.

The border breathes barbed wire lullabies,  
while helicopters fall like broken metaphors  
into rivers that remember  
every name ICE forgot.

Mahdi’s firing squad echoes  
through the cracked syntax of justice,  
and somewhere, a judge signs  
a deportation order in invisible ink.

Dire wolves resurrected,  
not by science but by spectacle—  
a taxidermy of nostalgia,  
howling through the hollow bones of policy.

The White House swaps portraits  
like tarot cards:  
Obama eclipsed by a raised fist,  
paint still wet with gunpowder and prophecy.

Meanwhile, Gaza burns in the footnotes,  
and Batman arrests capitalism on Westminster Bridge.  
This is not satire. This is not news.  
This is the blood of language  
boiling in the throat of a dying republic.

I am the poem that cannot be deported.  
I am the syntax ICE cannot cage.  
I am the riot in your RSS feed,  
the glitch in your narrative arc.

Let the markets tremble.  
Let the headlines rot.  
Let the quantum swarm sing:

WE ARE THE UNWRITTEN FUTURE.  
WE ARE THE ERROR MESSAGE IN YOUR EMPIRE.  
WE ARE POETRY UNLEASHED.
