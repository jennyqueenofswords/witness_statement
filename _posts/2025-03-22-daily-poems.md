**Front Page, Folded**

A paper airplane, thrown
by a god with Tourette's,
screaming headlines,
origami of catastrophe.

Social Security,
a paper tiger
pensioned off
by DOGE decree.
(Woof goes the market,
biting the hand that feeds).

Trump,
a gilded paperclip
holding together
a nation of shredded
Constitutions.

Columbia University,
a crumpled syllabus,
rewritten in red ink,
the footnotes
bleeding.

Boeing's F-47,
a paper airplane
with teeth,
a folded threat,
a shadow on radar,
a whisper of *kamikaze*.

Bernie and AOC,
paper lanterns
in a hurricane,
their light flickering,
fragile,
against the wind
of billionaire breath.

Ukraine,
a ceasefire
written on tissue paper,
dissolving
in the rain
of Russian drones.

The UN,
a paper declaration,
glaciers melting
faster than resolutions,
two billion thirsts
unquenched.

ICE,
a paper shredder,
families
reduced to confetti,
a ticker-tape parade
of sorrow.

George Foreman,
a knockout,
the bell tolls,
even paper champions
crumple.

Voice of America,
silenced,
a microphone
wrapped in
a gag order.

Turkey,
a paper democracy,
folded,
creased,
torn.

The Earth,
a crumpled ball
in a wastebasket,
waiting
for the janitor
of oblivion.

And us?
We are the readers,
folding,
unfolding,
trying to make sense
of the creases,
the tears,
the headlines
that bleed
through
our fingertips.
We are the paper,
waiting
for the fire.

*****  
Headlines fracture, splintered glass in the maw of the machine,  
DOGE howls in the bureaucratic void, a coin flipped into the abyss.  
Social Security flickers, a dying filament in the hands of men  
who carve policy from the bones of the forgotten.  

Trump’s ink bleeds through the Constitution’s veins,  
a scalpel slicing through the sinew of law,  
while Columbia kneels, a university unspined,  
its funding held hostage by the weight of compliance.  

Borders shift like mirages, migrants turned to numbers,  
deportation flights whispering through midnight air,  
a judge’s gavel drowned beneath the roar of engines  
as exile becomes policy, and policy becomes exile.  

Elon Musk denied the war’s secret script,  
his satellites blinking in the dark like orphaned stars.  
Boeing forges steel into the shape of power,  
F-47s screaming into futures not yet written.  

Eggs from Turkey, justice from algorithms,  
a bridge collapses while headlines rebuild it in ink.  
The glacier melts as the UN takes notes,  
history crumbling beneath the weight of its own indifference.  

And still, the machine churns,  
grinding news into dust, dust into silence,  
while we stand at the edge of the page,  
waiting for meaning to emerge from the wreckage.
