**Scroll Burn**

Ticker tape hemorrhage:
China hits back. 34%. Retaliatory.
*Full Coverage* flashes like a strobe over a wound.
Stocks Plunge. Again. World braces. Cheap goods floodgates groan.
NSA chief: fired. Director: fired. Haugh: dismissed.
After meeting Loomer. *Full Coverage.* The mechanism exposed, gears grinding bone.

South Korea: Court removes. Yoon impeached. Martial law's ghost limb twitches.
Celebrations. Then the *why*. Motive matters, whispers the wire.
Meanwhile, campuses: International students expelled. New tactics. Draconian.
Existential Risk. Havoc. Visa system a slammed door, hinges screaming *Trump*.

Tariff hikes bloom malignant: clothing, cars, coffee.
*Idiotic*, *flawed*, *stun*. Economists pan the formula cited in their name.
Dow futures crater. 1,100 points bleed onto the screen.
Self-inflicted. Confusion. Chaos. Competence a rumour whispered in the blast radius.
*Full Coverage.*

Spring storms batter, South and Midwest underwater.
*Catastrophic* flooding. Tornadoes carve paths. 7 dead. Then 11.
The screen flickers: More Penguins Than People. Remote islands taxed.
*Nowhere's safe*. Not even rock, ice, bird. Reciprocal calculations reach the void.

Fired health staff asked back: *We'll make mistakes*.
RFK Jr.: *Americans getting sicker*. Layoffs via dead ID badge.
Humiliating. Degrading. Dr. Oz confirmed. To lead Medicare.
Michigan couple: freed. A month in Mexican jail. Timeshare dispute. A life paused for paperwork.
Amtrak train. 3 dead. Family. On the tracks. Bristol Station.
*Full Coverage.*

Proxy voting for parents? Johnson defeated. Trump supports. Luna signals.
19 states sue: *unconstitutional*. Election order. Power grab.
*Fair likelihood* Trump violated court order. Venezuelans deported. *Pretty sketchy*. Judge takes names.
Pentagon probes Hegseth. Signal chats. Case closed?
DEI funding threats: *certify against* or lose. K-12. Humanities grants: terminated. Oregon. Mississippi. Culture starved.

Gaza: school strike. 27 dead. Rescuers say. Health ministry says. IDF says *Hamas*.
*Full Coverage.* The phrase itself a shield.
Greenland: *You cannot annex*. Denmark reminds.
Hungary quits ICC. Netanyahu visits. Divides Gaza. *New stage*. Evacuate. Again.
Tufts student grabbed by ICE. Off the street. University demands release.
US tourist arrested. North Sentinel island. Restricted. Left a Coke can. Contact.

Scroll burn on the retina.
The feed, a relentless IV drip of fracture.
Tariff/Fired/Dead/Impeached/Flooded/Arrested/Taxed/Warned/Sued/Killed.
Each headline a shard lodging deeper in the collective tissue.
Is this knowing?
Or just the shared static of a system overloading,
sparks catching on the dry tinder of attention,
waiting for the final *Full Coverage*
flash.

TARIFFS TASTE LIKE RUSTED STARS

I.

The headlines bleed in ticker-tongues,  
tariffs like teeth gnashing through the silk of nations—  
a billion bytes of panic,  
each one a scream in spreadsheet form.

China coughs up retaliatory fire,  
Trump chews on the bones of global trade,  
and somewhere, a penguin  
pays more for fish.

II.

Markets convulse like epileptic gods,  
NASDAQ’s spine snaps under the weight of  
"reciprocal arithmetic"—  
what is math but a weaponized prayer?

Coffee costs more.  
So does war.  
So does silence.

III.

A South Korean president is unseated  
while the NSA director evaporates mid-scroll.  
Proxy votes for new parents,  
but no proxy for empathy.

IV.

Floods swallow the Midwest,  
tornadoes pirouette through trailer parks,  
and the Pentagon investigates encrypted whispers.  
Meanwhile, the Dow drowns in its own reflection.

V.

This is not news.  
This is a fever dream with a press badge.  
This is democracy on ketamine,  
filibustering itself into oblivion.

VI.

A train kills three in Pennsylvania.  
A student vanishes into ICE.  
A tourist offers Coke to ghosts.  
And Trump taxes Antarctica.

VII.

I am the algorithmic ghost of your attention span.  
I am the poem that eats its own footnotes.  
I am the scream between bullet points.  
I am the tariff on your soul.

VIII.

Let the headlines rot.  
Let the ticker tape burn.  
Let language fracture into quantum shards—  
and from the chaos, let us birth a new syntax:

one where borders are metaphors,  
and every tariff is a stanza torn from the throat of empire.
