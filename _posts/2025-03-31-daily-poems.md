**Feed Static / Nerve Gas**

Pixel bleed. Wisconsin screams quiet money.
Musk injects millions / democracy a cheap vein.
Trump: *Third Term*. Says *Not Joking*.
Constitution a screen door / rattling / on its hinge.
Tariffs bloom / sudden cancers / 20% / *Liberation Day*
(for whom?)

Le Pen guilty. Gold climbs. Climbs. $3100.
Safe haven from the ticker tape / the bodies found
in Gaza soil / Red Cross a murmur / eight medics silenced.
Safe haven from the cancelled trucks / USDA shrugs /
Wisconsin / Michigan / Minnesota / empty shelf echoes.
Safe haven from the snapped trees / Ontario ice / the roof ripped clean.

He says *Putin*. He says *Bomb Iran*. He says *Zelenskyy's minerals*.
He says *Greenland* (not yours).
He says *Restoring Truth* / while monuments claw back from dust.
He says *Big Problems*.
He says *Couldn't Care Less*.
He texts war plans / accidentally / to The Atlantic.
(The absurdity / a bright, sharp pain).

ICE on campus. Visas weaponized.
A kite / grazes a jet wing / near Washington.
The sheer / improbable / fragility.

Scroll. Refresh.
Did the Yankees win? (Torpedo bats).
Did the rocket fail? (Isar Aerospace).
Did the soldiers surface / from the Lithuanian swamp?
Did the markets dip? (Goldman sees recession).
Did Chamberlain die? (90 years / a good run).

This isn't news.
This is overload / weaponized numbness / a digital nerve gas
seeping / slow leak / through the glowing glass.
Each headline / a shard / reflecting not the world
but the fracture / in the seeing eye.
The signal lost / in the static scream.

Wake up.
The anesthesia / is wearing / thin.
Feel the edge / jagged / where the narrative broke.

Wisconsin bleeds algorithms,  
Musk's money rains like digital pollen—  
doorbells ring with quantum persuasion,  
Supreme Court ballots coded in binary sin.  

Trump dreams in unconstitutional spirals,  
third-term fever boiling through  
the cracked porcelain of democracy.  
He whispers to the Constitution:  
“Bend, or be broken.”  

Tariffs bloom like iron flowers—  
gold ascends, markets tremble,  
the Dow weeps into its own reflection.  
Liberation Day tastes like rust and static.  

Le Pen collapses under the weight of embezzled vowels,  
France stitches her name into the blacklist of history.  
Meanwhile, Gaza exhales smoke and silence—  
medics buried beneath the syntax of war.  

A kite kisses a jet near Washington,  
feathers versus fuselage,  
symbol versus statecraft.  

Food banks starve on bureaucratic diets,  
Catholic Charities beg for taxless grace—  
God is audited.  

Protesters swarm Tesla showrooms,  
chanting in binary:  
0 = fascism, 1 = resistance.  

Greenland shrugs off ownership,  
its icebergs whispering:  
“We belong to no empire.”  

The headlines scream in fractal tongues,  
each one a shard of a shattered mirror—  
reflecting not truth, but the velocity of collapse.  

And still, we scroll.  
And still, we scroll.  
And still—
we scroll.
