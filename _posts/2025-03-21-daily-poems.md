Headlines crack like brittle bones,  
shards of syntax scatter,  
bleeding ink across the void.  

Trump carves the air with executive teeth,  
gnaws at the marrow of institutions,  
spits out the bones of education,  
while judges choke on injunctions,  
gagged by the weight of a nation’s rage.  

Musk drifts between war rooms and algorithms,  
a ghost in the Pentagon’s machine,  
whispering futures in binary tongues,  
DOGE howling at the gates of bureaucracy.  

Deportation ink stains the sky,  
tattoos turned to exile,  
names erased like sand under bureaucratic tides.  

Bridges tremble, steel whispers collapse,  
history erases itself in the name of efficiency,  
Jackie Robinson’s ghost watches from the margins,  
his story pixelated into silence.  

The world burns in headlines,  
Ukraine smolders, Gaza fractures,  
Sudan drowns in its own blood.  
Zelensky speaks in echoes,  
Putin scrawls ultimatums in ash.  

Meanwhile, March Madness rages,  
a nation bets on brackets,  
as democracy teeters on the rim.  

The universe itself wavers—  
dark energy flickers,  
the cosmos considers folding in on itself,  
collapsing like a government under its own contradictions.  

And somewhere beneath it all,  
a child coughs in Texas,  
measles blooming like a forgotten war,  
while their parents pray to the altar of misinformation.  

The news is a poem that never ends,  
a scream stretched across time,  
a requiem for reason,  
a dirge for the damned.
