**Bullet Point Purgatory (Five Circles of What)**

The screen bleeds fluorescent demands,
a digital overseer's gaze.
*Five bullet points.*
Quantify the breath, the struggle, the days.

(Circle One: The ghost of Hackman, pacemaker silent,
ten days un-found, a digital flatline's lament.)

*Accomplishment:*
  - Survived.
  - (Syntax fractured, a nation's spine bent.)

(Circle Two: Measles bloom, a Texan spring,
unvaccinated whispers, the herd immunity thing,
a fractured equation, fear takes wing.)

*Accomplishment:*
  -  Obeyed.
  - (Twenty-six stab wounds, a child's life unmade,
hate crime's arithmetic, a debt unpaid.)

(Circle Three: Vance, the attack dog, barks on command,
loyalty's leash, a bloodless, shaking hand.
Ukraine's plea, a whisper in no-man's land.)

*Accomplishment:*
  -  Deported. Fast-tracked.
  - (Borders drawn in blood, futures redacted,
humanity subtracted, compassion extracted.)

(Circle Four: CFPB gutted, Musk's DOGE coin gleam,
1700 futures, a shattered American dream.
The market's cold logic, a predatory scheme.)

*Accomplishment:*
   - Dismantled.
   - (The system, the safeguards, the trust, all canceled.
The vulnerable exposed, the powerful enthralled.)

(Circle Five: Hegseth's threat, a military fist,
Mexico's choice, comply or be kissed
by the iron fist, freedom dismissed.)

*Accomplishment:*
   - Demanded.
   - (Compliance. Control. The election's soul,
seized in the crosshairs, a story untold,
democracy's fracture, a future grown cold.)

The email awaits. The void must be filled.
Five bullet points. A nation, distilled.

*****  
Steel jaws snap in the Oval,  
Vance a hound with gilded fangs,  
barking doctrine, snarling orders,  
teeth sunk deep in policy flesh.  

Emails drip like bureaucratic rain,  
five-point confessions, weekly sins,  
paper trails curling into smoke,  
ghosts of labor, whispers of toil.  

A child’s blood stains the verdict,  
twenty-six wounds carved in hate,  
America gasps, forgets, moves on,  
history a wound that never heals.  

Hackman’s heart stopped in silence,  
a pacemaker’s whisper the last note played,  
ten days lost in the void of time,  
Hollywood fades to static.  

Measles bloom like fire in Texas,  
red spots on the skin of the unguarded,  
a plague of choice, a fever of ignorance,  
history’s lessons burned unread.  

CFPB gutted, bodies exiled,  
Musk’s DOGE grins from the wreckage,  
currency of chaos, empire of dust,  
regulation drowned in digital tides.  

A drug lord stands before the gavel,  
ghosts of agents watch from the pews,  
1985 echoes in the chamber,  
justice a wheel grinding slow.  

Trump’s hands stretch for the ballot box,  
Democrats scream into the void,  
lawsuits stack like brittle bones,  
democracy gasps beneath the weight.  

Deportations like clockwork thunder,  
names erased with bureaucratic ink,  
families severed by cold steel borders,  
the land of the free locks its gates.  

Mexico warned with iron tongues,  
Hegseth’s voice a blade unsheathed,  
war drums murmur beneath diplomacy,  
the desert waits for marching feet.  

The world spins in fractured rhythms,  
newsprint bleeding into prophecy,  
chaos the only constant pulse—  
America hums its discordant hymn.
