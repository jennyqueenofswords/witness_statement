**Feed | Static | Bloom**

Papal casket gloss. White smoke signal fading.
Then: Tariff threat retracts—a market gasp, a wire pulled taut then slack.
*U-turn substantial* whispers the screen between deportation blocks
and courtrooms echoing hollow threats. ICE bus reverses slow motion
video loop rewind repeat.

Whose future direction? Church? State? Stock?
The scroll bleeds pixels: Kashmir calm shattered (26 bodies, count them)
Istanbul fault lines groan (6.2 Richter shudder)
NJ wildfire breathes smoke across state lines (8,500 acres ash).

Panic is currency. Trump’s comments / China’s control. Analysts parse.
Hegseth’s unsecured chats bloom like digital mould. *Espionage target.*
Millionaire tax floated, a trial balloon pricked by the next cycle.
Supreme Court weighs stories, who gets told, who gets opted-out.
*Parental rights* vs the small hand reaching for a page.

Vance ultimatum. Rubio snubs. Peace talks fray like old flags.
*Crimea is Russian* proposed ahead of talks. Maps redrawn in boardrooms.
State Dept gutted slow, a bureaucratic bleed-out. *Values* a line item.
Approval ratings dip, dive, yet *authoritarian ambition* polls steady.

Doomsday mom convicted. Judge convicted. Sharpe accused. Nyweide gone (24).
Click. A life compressed to headline. Tragedy as content.
Student visas cancelled / reinstated / lives paused mid-air.
*National disgrace* say lawmakers visiting cages. Click. Image captured.

Putin offers pause / along the *current* front line. A tactical breath.
Harvard fights back / *frantically tried* / funding axe hangs heavy.
Student loans reactivated. The collection engine grinds.
Coal miners cough / health protections cut / *black lung* a footnote.
'60 Minutes' chief walks / *independence compromised*. Who owns the narrative?
Musk pivots / DOGE whimpers / Tesla dips. Gods of the algorithm hiccup.
EU fines tech giants / billions evaporate / reappear elsewhere.

Stocks surge on Powell reprieve. *No intention* (today).
Voice of America unmuted / judge intervenes.
RFK Jr targets dyes / autism registry grows / *sugar is poison*.
NFL draft prospects ranked / measles blooms / Oblivion *remastered*. Nostalgia rush.

The feed.
A relentless autopsy.
Disparate traumas stitched side-by-side.
Grief flattened to data point.
Outrage optimized for engagement.

White space screams between the lines—
the unsaid, the unfelt, the connection severed
by the sheer volume
of the breaking.

This isn't knowledge.
It's the weight.
The digital sediment burying us
softly
in place.

Conclave of collapsing headlines,  
papal breath stitched into algorithmic silence—  
Francis lies in state while the world  
screams through ticker tape veins.

Tariffs spiral like locusts,  
Trump's tongue a Möbius strip of U-turns,  
China whispers in yen and vengeance,  
while markets pirouette on broken ankles.

Rubio rearranges the State Department  
like a child gutting a dollhouse—  
plastic limbs of diplomacy scattered  
across the linoleum of empire.

Earthquake in Istanbul,  
6.2 on the Richter scale of divine indifference.  
Buildings weep dust,  
and still the stock market smiles.

Kashmir bleeds again—  
tourists turned statistics,  
love letters to violence written in gunpowder.  
A bride salutes a coffin; the honeymoon is ash.

The Supreme Court sketches morality  
in crayon and crucifix,  
parents opt out of stories,  
but not from history’s sharp teeth.

Lori Daybell dances with ghosts,  
a doomsday waltz through courtroom echoes.  
Judges shoot wives,  
and justice wears a blindfold soaked in blood.

RFK Jr. collects your children’s tongues,  
files them alphabetically by dye number.  
Red 40 is outlawed;  
but rage remains FDA approved.

Universities howl against the orange specter,  
but still invite him to speak—  
commencement as contradiction,  
diplomas inked in complicity.

Oblivion remastered,  
because we cannot stop reliving it.  
Mods for memory, patches for pain—  
Skyrim never had this much grief.

The globe spins under a fevered thumb,  
headlines swarm like hornets drunk on gasoline.  
This is not news. This is necromancy.  
This is the resurrection of ruin.

And Pope Francis?  
He thanks a nurse for Easter air—  
while we choke on the incense of empire,  
and call it breath.
