*****
(Caesarean Birth of a Stillborn Republic)

The scalpel, a tweet, slices the membrane.
Zelenskyy, a ghost in amber, *legitimate*,
while the parliament votes itself eternal.
(Democracy, a word coughed up, blood-flecked,
on the operating table.)

Musk's DOGE shock troops, *moppy haircuts*
demanding databases, a digital coup
in casual wear.  Move fast, break things,
(the Constitution, a shattered vase,
shards reflecting a fractured sky).

Bongino, the anti-body, now head of the host,
*irredeemably corrupt*, the diagnosis
inverted, the disease now the cure.
(Irony, a rusty nail, driven deep
into the coffin of truth).

Johnson's budget, a prayer on frayed wings,
Fyre Festival reborn, a mirage of solvency.
Ramaswamy, the endorsed, a puppet on strings,
(Hope, a flickering candle, snuffed out
by a hurricane of hot air).

The Pope, *double pneumonia*, blessing saints
from a deathbed, decrees from the precipice.
(Faith, a ventilator, wheezing its last,
while the world outside burns).

Ukraine, weaponless, a summer's reprieve,
before the sophisticated silence descends.
(Freedom, a fading echo, lost in the static
of abandoned allies).

Puppy Mountain, a photographic lie,
a tourist trap built on a trick of the light.
(Reality, a shifting landscape, where even
the adorable is a manufactured illusion).

Mars, red with a secret, finally revealed,
a cosmic rust mirroring our own decay.
(The universe, a vast, indifferent mirror,
reflecting our self-inflicted wounds).

Democrats, a playbook of targeted cuts,
Medicaid, a lifeline frayed, DOGE, a meme
weaponized against the vulnerable.
(Politics, a game of calculated cruelty,
played on the backs of the dying).

Apple, *designed in California*, assembled
in the sweatshops of a globalized lie.
(Progress, a hollow promise, stamped on a box
filled with the ghosts of exploited labor).

The scalpel slips. The baby is blue.
The republic, stillborn. The silence, absolute.

[poem]  

Wartime clocks refuse to tick,  
Zelenskyy frozen in amber light,  
Trump’s shadow claws at the glass—  
but the ballot box is buried deep  
beneath the rubble of Mariupol.  

DOGE men storm the citadel,  
hoodies and hubris,  
Musk’s apostles rewriting code,  
rewriting law,  
rewriting the bones of bureaucracy.  

Bongino grips the FBI’s throat,  
whispers sweet nothings of corruption,  
a serpent crowned in steel-toed boots,  
Patel nods, the agents kneel—  
the machine hums anew.  

Johnson prays to a deficit god,  
his budget a brittle hymn,  
while Trump anoints Ramaswamy,  
a golden calf for the faithful.  

The Pope exhales dust and doctrine,  
lungs heavy with sainthood,  
as Rome waits for the final breath—  
or another miracle.  

Ukraine counts its missiles like rosary beads,  
each shell a whispered prayer for summer.  

And somewhere in China,  
a mountain of puppies rises,  
soft rebellion against the weight of war.  

Mars still bleeds red in the night sky,  
as if it knows something we don’t.
