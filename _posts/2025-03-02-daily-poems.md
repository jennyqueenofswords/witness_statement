**Gaza. Moon. (Angie). 2025.**

A drill, a vacuum, a *special delivery*
for the cold, pocked face.
(Science fiction, fact.)

Meanwhile, six weeks of *halted*
becomes forever.
Aid, a blocked artery.

The word *ceasefire*
a tourniquet
tightening.

(Somewhere, a van
collides with a semi.
*Rollover*. A voice, stilled.)

Europe *shores up*.
Trump *blows out*.
Taxes *spiral*.

The powerful gather,
*packed to the brim*
at the Polo Lounge.

Chanel.
Finch.
*Storied*.

(A carrier *arrives*.
Missiles *demonstrate*.
A firing, *illegal*.)

We map the craters
of other worlds,
while this one

bleeds.

aid trucks pause

*****  
Steel birds scream over salted earth,  
hunger barricaded behind iron laws,  
a ceasefire stitched with broken thread—  
who will eat the silence?  

Summits rise like paper palaces,  
Zelenskyy’s shadow stretched thin  
across a table of clenched fists,  
while echoes of an Oval fury  
burn through diplomatic veils.  

Moon dust cradles a metal ghost,  
whispers of vacuum and drill,  
while down below, debt spirals  
like a dying star collapsing inward,  
swallowed by the weight of permanence.  

Angie Stone’s voice—now a comet,  
spinning through the wreckage of time,  
melody lost in the shatter of steel,  
rhythm buried beneath asphalt prayers.  

Trump’s hand strikes again,  
a watchdog’s throat cut in the dark,  
while warships kiss foreign shores,  
missiles winking like distant gods.  

Cuomo resurrects from scandal’s grave,  
a phoenix or a vulture—who can say?  
Hollywood drowns in Chanel and champagne,  
while hunger waits at the border’s gate.  

DOGE laughs in Musk’s electric grip,  
free tax dreams turned to digital dust—  
and still, the world turns,  
a broken wheel grinding bones to silence.
