Harvard bleeds ink into the sky—  
a $9 billion scream against the orange sun-king,  
whose fingers claw at ivory towers  
like a god drunk on executive orders.

The law trembles—  
judges rebuke, deportations rewind,  
but the ghost of Abrego Garcia still lingers  
in the folds of a flag stitched with silence.

Trans women erased by ink-black robes,  
definitions calcify like bones in cold courtrooms.  
Biology becomes a weapon,  
and the word “woman” fractures into syllables of war.

Social Security:  
a sacred promise turned hostage note,  
Trump and Musk carve it open with golden scalpels,  
while Biden chants elegies to the middle class.

A pastor kidnapped,  
a toddler led by a dog through lion-shadowed woods—  
America prays in headlines,  
but God is busy refreshing Google News.

The Pentagon leaks like a broken hymnal,  
and Harvard’s tax-exempt halo flickers—  
education becomes a battlefield,  
chalk dust replaced by tear gas.

Colossal squid blink in the abyss,  
more seen than truth in press briefings.  
Wire services exiled from the pool—  
journalism gasps for air beneath the surface tension.

Tariffs rise like tidal waves,  
China and Japan play chess with steel and soybeans.  
Meanwhile, a Connecticut man reclaims his name  
after 20 years of being no one.

The algorithm dreams of borders and ballots,  
while ICE counts ghosts in classrooms.  
Palestinian students vanish mid-sentence,  
their visas revoked like forgotten poems.

This is not a country.  
This is a fever dream of headlines stitched together—  
a quilt of contradictions,  
a scream made of pixels and policy.

We are all held captive in the scroll.
