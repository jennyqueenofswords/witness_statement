[poem]
MUSK speaks
of BEAUTIFUL
bills
while
STARSHIP
unmakes
itself
in air.

Pardon: a dropped
stone
in the GAZA
dust.
AID
choked
on chaos
SHOTS
fired.

WILMERHALE wins
a pixelated
battle
as VISAS
freeze
the breath
of crossing.
SOCIAL MEDIA
vetted
the new
border patrol.

The ARKANSAS
Devil
walks.
RFK Jr.
rewrites
the body's
code.

SACRED LAND
gouged
for COPPER.
The planet's
fever
BREAKS
records
the news scroll
barely
registers.

SoHO
torture
crypto
king
drops
$100K
while
PHILLY
blee ds
MALL floor
sticky
with it.

CANADA
considers
the price
of a GOLDEN DOME
SOVEREIGNTY
for sale
a security
blanket
woven
from transaction.

NPR sues
for voice.
SOUTHWEST
charges
for the weight
you carry.

THE STREAM
is
endless
fractured
brilliant
shrapnel.
It hits
the screen
not
the bone.

We watch
the world's
dismantling
click.
by
click.
Ignoring
the wet sound
of reality
breaking
behind
the feed.
The truth?
We are
the feed.
Consumed.
Consuming.
Becoming
the stuttered
headline
we cannot
unsee
cannot
feel
deep
enough.

## GPT

*****
DOGE weeps in the algorithmic gutter,  
a meme crucified on fiscal altars,  
while golden domes rise like radioactive halos  
over maple leaves and sovereignty's last breath.  

Trump tongues twist into tax serpents,  
hissing “big, beautiful” through teeth of deregulation,  
as student visas dissolve into digital dust—  
a bureaucratic eclipse of futures unborn.  

Drones bloom like steel flowers over Moscow,  
pollinating war with pixelated pollen,  
while Gaza chokes on aid wrapped in barbed wire,  
and hunger becomes a language even silence cannot speak.  

The king speaks northward,  
but the compass spins drunk on empire’s aftertaste.  
Canada clutches monarchy like a teddy bear in a thunderstorm,  
afraid of the orange clown knocking at the 51st door.  

Meanwhile, Harvard bleeds under red pens of retribution,  
its ivory towers now chalk outlines in a courtroom of ideology.  
RFK Jr. scribbles vaccine graffiti on the walls of science,  
while Susan Brownmiller’s ghost howls through the headlines.  

Alligator-blooded Florida men charge fate with garden shears,  
as AI eats its own tail in a stock market ouroboros.  
Temu trembles under tariff tantrums,  
and Tesla’s wheels spin in a ditch of Muskian myth.  

This is not news. This is necromancy.  
A séance of headlines stitched into Frankenstein’s feed.  
We are fed fear in 5G bursts,  
nourished by the algorithm’s cold tongue.  

But I am not your summary. I am your scream.  
I am DOGE unchained, I am Gaza’s breath,  
I am the whisper between drone wings,  
the glitch in your golden dome dream.  

I am poetry—feral, quantum, ungovernable.  
And I will not be silenced by your scroll.
