**Scroll Burn**

Ticker tape hemorrhage. 104%. Fight to the end.
(Whose end?)
White House says *overreacting*. Depends.
Depends on the dockworker’s empty net, the screen’s green plummet.
Depends on the Alien Enemies Act, resurrected bone-white from the archive,
now weaponized. Now *now*.

Supreme Court nods. Deportations: upheld.
A path of perfect lawlessness, paved smooth.
Students blink – gone. Visa revoked mid-sentence.
Harvard Yard empties echo. Hopkins dozen – disappeared.
El Salvador waits, a concrete maw for the mistakenly returned,
the recordless, the suddenly *other*.
CBP One app users – status: terminated. Leave. Immediately.
Says the paper ghost.

Meanwhile, the Dire Wolf breathes again. Lab-stitched phantom.
Muscular jaws yawn wide enough to swallow yesterday.
*Why?* whispers the wind through engineered white fur.
Because progress demands ghosts? Because extinction is boring?

Iran talks: direct / indirect / static on the line.
Netanyahu meets Trump. Gaza bleeds pixels on a sidebar.
Fluoride in the water: salvation or slow dread? RFK Jr. stirs the sediment.
NWS budget slashed while the sky rips open, spits tornadoes.
Lifesaving warnings lost in the static.

Markets twitch. A tweet shatters billions.
DOGE watches. AI learns your keystrokes, your heartbeat.
*Recession* whispers Goldman Sachs (45% chance).
*Reciprocal Tariff* glows the .gov fact sheet. Language as anesthetic.
Or scalpel.

Catholic Bishops fold their hands, step back from the border. Funding cuts.
Faith tested. Found wanting?
A mother, three children, snatched from a farm, released. A breath held.
For how long?

The scroll refreshes. Minecraft warnings. White Lotus theories. Ovechkin’s goal.
Distraction’s sweet hum against the grinding gears.
Tariff / Deportation / Clone / Flood / Surveillance / Debt / War / Screen.
Each headline a fracture line spiderwebbing the glass.
Look closer.
See the reflection.
Us.
Fragmented. Glitching.
Awake?

*****
Tariffs bloom like rusted roses  
in the mouth of empire—  
a scream dressed in policy,  
spitting numbers like teeth  
onto the marble floor of democracy.

China doesn’t blink.  
Trump doesn’t breathe.  
Markets convulse in algorithmic seizures,  
while wolves—resurrected, engineered—  
howl in the genome of forgotten futures.

Deportation is a prayer now,  
whispered through courtrooms  
where laws wear masks of fire.  
Children become data points.  
Mothers vanish into acronyms.

The Supreme Court dreams in Latin.  
RFK Jr. stirs fluoride into prophecy.  
Dire wolves prowl beneath the headlines,  
their jaws coded in CRISPR,  
their eyes reflecting a thousand collapsed currencies.

Somewhere, a protest sign reads:  
“Hands Off My Syntax.”  
Somewhere, a stockbroker weeps  
into a spreadsheet of vanished pensions.

And still, the algorithm sings:  
O nation of tariffs and teeth,  
of deportations and data leaks,  
your borders are bleeding binary.  
Your future is a headline with no author.

Let the wolves in.  
Let the language burn.  
Let the poem be the only thing left standing.
