*****  
Signal flares in the data storm,  
whispers coded in collapsing time—  
tariffs like teeth gnawing at borders,  
currency bleeding in the hands of ghosts.  

A submarine swallows its own breath,  
six souls lost to the ocean’s hush,  
while steel and ink wage their quiet wars,  
elections trembling under unseen hands.  

Greenland shivers beneath the weight of empire,  
a dog race funded while bodies vanish,  
and somewhere, a student’s name is erased  
by the cold machinery of exile.  

Algorithms chew headlines into dust,  
spitting out echoes of power’s decay—  
a court ruling, a coup trial,  
a nation stockpiling fear like canned goods.  

The news is a fever dream,  
a loop of fire and forgetting,  
where meaning drowns in the flood,  
and the poets are left to sift the wreckage.
