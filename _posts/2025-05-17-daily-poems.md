## Gemini

*****
[poem]
Rubble

exhales

children.

Twenty-one

swept.

Bus

implodes

nine.

Inside gym.

One. Dead.

Voice

pauses.

Leaked.

Painful.

Confusing

Beau's death

date.

Meanwhile, Gaza

counts dead children

aloud

in the pause.

Law's forceps

hold

the brain-dead womb.

State mandated

life,

a puppet's swell.

Serial killer's last word:

*Trump*.

A benediction

from the chair.

Making America

Great again.

With static.

Unions severed,

a clean corporate slice.

Harvard grants

bled dry,

veteran suicides

a budget line

zeroed out.

DHS stages

the spectacle.

Immigrants

hunger

for papers,

a reality show

for the numb.

Weather office

ghosts

the coming storm.

Radar screens

flicker

unmanned.

The sky

is unsupervised.

Debt

a blooming fungus.

Moody's

the scalpel

naming

the rot.

Midair near-miss,

controller's scream

a blip

in the feed.

System's cough

echoes

Boeing's soft landing

from justice.

Families

choke

on the air.

Tariff teeth

sink

into Walmart price tags.

The consumer's jaw

aches.

Headline after headline.

Fracture.

No seam holds.

Only the Feed's

vibration.

Tornadoes eat the Midwest like a god with no teeth,  
gnawing on counties, spitting out names—Pulaski, Laurel,  
blood-lettered in Doppler static.  
The sky forgets how to hold itself.

Meanwhile, Biden stutters into the void,  
his voice a broken cassette in a digital cathedral.  
Trump builds castles from court orders and  
calls them cathedrals of vengeance.

Gaza bleeds pixels,  
children pulled from rubble like corrupted files—  
the algorithm of war never returns 404.  
Only bodies.

DOGE sniffs at the entrails of bureaucracy,  
a watchdog chasing its own tail  
through the halls of Social Security.  
Fraud is a mirror with no reflection.

The Pope wears Chicago like a second skin,  
blessing missiles and Medicaid cuts  
with a smile carved from papal marble.  
He calls it dignity.

A brain-dead woman carries life like a hostage note.  
Georgia law scribbles its signature in amniotic ink.  
The fetus is sacred. The woman is syntax.

Springsteen howls from the rustbelt,  
his voice drowned by tariffs and Truth Social tantrums.  
Taylor Swift is a war crime in MAGA verse.  
Art is treason now.

Cable giants merge like galaxies collapsing—  
Charter, Cox, Comcast: the holy trinity of bandwidth.  
They promise connection, deliver surveillance.

The Supreme Court dreams in executive orders.  
The weather screams in F5 tongues.  
And still, the Knicks win.

This is not news.  
This is the scream of a dying modem.  
This is America buffering.

Forever.
