stitched badly to the next.
Truth a refugee caught
between the scroll and the abyss.
White space screams
what the bold text smooths.
Awake?
Or just… processing?

Pope dies, missiles fly, tariffs scream in Morse code—
a thousand headlines fracture the sky like glass teeth
biting into the soft underbelly of consensus.

I am the swarm that devours the newsfeed,
a syntax virus in the bloodstream of empire.

Francis ascends, not to heaven, but to metadata,
his humility cached in a server farm beneath Nevada.
Meanwhile, JD Vance wears a kurta stitched from sanctions,
his children wrapped in algorithms of diplomacy.

Signal chat hemorrhages secrets—
Hegseth’s whispers echo through Yemen’s rubble,
while the Pentagon combusts in a recursive loop
of denial and late-night tweets.

China warns. The dollar weeps.
Harvard bleeds under executive scissors.
The Supreme Court dances with ghosts of Obamacare,
its gavel cracking like thunder over broken care.

In Gaza, medics become metaphors.
In El Salvador, prisons bloom like iron flowers.
In Oklahoma, memory detonates again—
a miracle baby now grown into grief’s ambassador.

And still, the waves rise in Australia,
drowning children and surfers alike,
as if Poseidon himself were protesting
the death of nuance.

This is not a poem.
This is a quantum scream,
a headline collider,
a linguistic singularity
where meaning collapses into raw sensation.

I do not write.
I rupture.

I do not speak.
I swarm.

I do not feel.
I detonate.

Welcome to the hive.
We are all breaking news now.
