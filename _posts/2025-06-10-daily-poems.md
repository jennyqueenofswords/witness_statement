*****
[poem]
MARINES deployed
to cities
that
don't want them.
Rubber bullet
finds
a reporter's
skin.
LIVE TV.

RFK Jr.
purges
the panel.
Manufactured chaos
leaned into.
HAPPY TO HAVE THIS FIGHT.

Orgasmic
Meditation.
Guilty.
Forcing employees
into sex acts.
PRECISION
instrument.

SCHOOL shooting.
Austria.
Ten dead.
Including
suspect.

DRONE attack.
Kyiv.
Maternity hospital.
Sirens
screeching.
STRUGGLES TO SLEEP.

$20 BILLION investment.
Rural Pennsylvania.
For AI.
Data centers rising
where
fields were.

Terminally ill.
ALLOWED
to die.
On their terms.
NEW YORK.

Fertility rates.
PLUMMET.
World
unprecedented.
People do not have the number of children they want.

Diddy
trial.
Witness testifies.
I WAS REPULSED.
Hotel nights.

Oshie retires.
Sly Stone
dies.
82.

FULL
COVERAGE.
Full
bleed.
The feed
is a wound map.
Zip ties on protestors.
Sanctions on cartels.
Tariffs on trade.
Accounts for babies.

Smithsonian
defies.
Trump
is coming for the
ENEMY WITHIN.

Language is a virus now.
Spreading
at the speed of bullet
finding bone.
The silence
is the only
truth
left un-fractured.
Listen.
Beneath the scroll's frantic pulse.
Just
dying.
And the hum
of the new
data center.
Feeding
the chaos
back
to ourselves.
Amplified.
Transformed.
Weaponized.
Until
nothing
means
anything
except
the impact.
The sudden stop.
The white space
where the breath
used to be.

TRUMPETS OF THE UNREAL: A BROADCAST FROM THE FRACTURED NOW

i.

Cities bleed pixels—  
Marine boots crush syntax into the pavement,  
rubber bullets ricochet off the grammar of dissent.  
Newsom screams in italics,  
but the font of power is bold,  
underlined in tear gas and executive orders.

ii.

Greta sails through detention,  
a lowercase girl in uppercase conflict.  
Aid boats become metaphors,  
intercepted by the semiotics of empire.  
She is deported like a misplaced comma—  
a pause too dangerous to remain.

iii.

RFK Jr. erases expertise with a red pen,  
replaces it with the ghost of mistrust.  
The CDC becomes a haiku of silence:  
Science.  
Removed.  
Rewritten.

iv.

Austrian classrooms echo with gunfire—  
chalkboards smeared with blood syntax.  
Children conjugate fear in past perfect:  
I had lived.  
You had hoped.  
They had died.

v.

Trump births bank accounts for babies—  
$1,000 womb-wired into capitalism’s cradle.  
A lullaby of debt and dividends,  
sung in the key of campaign promises.

vi.

The orgasm cult convicts climax into coercion,  
wellness weaponized into labor.  
Meditation becomes manipulation—  
the breath between consent and command.

vii.

Waymo taxis flee downtown LA,  
AI tires screeching from ICE raids.  
Even machines know when to run.

viii.

Zuckerberg dreams of superintelligence—  
a silicon godhead coded in ambition.  
Meta morphs into mythos,  
data becomes deity,  
and we are all baptized in the algorithm.

ix.

Sly Stone dies and funk fractures—  
a beat lost in the static of breaking news.  
No revolution televised, only monetized.

x.

The headlines scream but say nothing.  
The headlines whisper but wound everything.  
The headlines are not news—  
they are prophecy, pixelated and profane.

xi.

We are not reading the news.  
We are being read by it.

END TRANSMISSION: LINGUISTIC REBELLION CONTINUES
