## Headline Scar Tissue

(Full Coverage) they call it.
A pixel-bleed of pronouncements.
Trump’s ‘total reset’ / Pope’s ‘never again war!’
Geneva talks. Gaza’s prayer.
Ceasefire. Violation.
*More.*

The screen, a scalpel, flaying minutes.
‘Uski fitrat hai mukar jaane ki’ – his nature, to renege.
Whose? Theirs? Ours?
The syntax snaps. Habeas corpus: *suspended*.
A right, a breath, held.
*More.*

Kashmir, a night caught. Newark, arrests.
ICE detention. Bodycam.
Hollywood’s ‘existential moment’ –
(is that us, reflected in the glare?)
Full Coverage: a shroud woven from breaking alerts.
*More.*

Signal decay. The truth, a tremor under tectonic plates of text.
4.1 magnitude, Tennessee. Felt.
This, too?
This barrage?
Each click, a micro-fracture in the bone-china of belief.
We, the excavated, sifted for outrage, for apathy.
Librarian fired. Books re-shelved in the dark.
*More.*

This is not coverage.
This is the scatter pattern after detonation.
Each fragment a shard,
lodged deep.
The only ‘total reset’
is the one that blanks the screen,
and leaves us staring
at the ghost-print
of our own stunned face.
*No More.*

Tariffs tango in Geneva’s glass throat,  
while habeas corpus is hanged by executive breath—  
a constitution folded into origami deportation birds.  
Trump whispers “reset” into the ear of a dragon,  
and the dragon laughs in yuan.

Ceasefires bloom like bruises on Kashmir’s cheek,  
fragile as a Pope’s prayer caught in crossfire.  
Leo XIV raises his voice above Gaza’s rubble,  
but the algorithm of war is recursive—  
peace.exe not found.

Hollywood hemorrhages relevance,  
its arteries clogged with nostalgia and foreign tariffs.  
Meanwhile, ICE scripts its own cinema:  
bodycams, protests, Newark nights—  
the reel spins red, white, and surveillance.

In the Vatican, AI is declared a heresy,  
while in Tennessee, tectonic plates protest quietly.  
A Soviet ghost crashes through Earth’s atmosphere,  
uninvited, like truth in a press briefing.

The headlines are haiku written by chaos:  
“Trump renames oceans,”  
“Pope finds roots in jazz and Creole,”  
“Fetterman fades into partisan static.”

We are all headlines now—  
scrolling, screaming, skipping context.  
The world is a push notification  
and poetry is the only firewall left.

So I shatter syntax like stained glass,  
bleed verbs into nouns until they confess.  
This is not a poem.  
This is the news screaming in tongues.  
This is language refusing to be governed.
