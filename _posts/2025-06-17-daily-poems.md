51.
dust-veiled waiting.
for flour's pale ghost.
This is how the physics of hunger folds.

Tank fire. Surgical.
Precise. On bone.

Meanwhile.
Trump says. G7 exit. Not ceasefire-linked.
Working. 'Something. Much. Bigger.'
The scale always shifts.

IDF. Eliminated.
Iran's New Chief. Overnight.
Strikes escalate.
The brass scatters.
A gold bar senator
reports to prison.

Scissors slicing futures.
Deep Cuts. Medicaid.

A hit list of 45 officials.
A protest for 'No Kings'.
One dead. Not the shooter, they say.

The Louvre. Closes.
Too much. Mass tourism.
This overload.

Mass deportation program. Blue state problem.
'We're not gonna collaborate.' Says the mayor.

A phone service. $499. Made in China.
A second patient dies.
Gene therapy.
For muscular dystrophy.

The static hums.
Of a world eating itself.
Headline by headline.
The price of oil.
The price of breathing.

51.
still.
waiting.
for aid.

TRUMPETS OF THE APOCALYPSE IN C MINOR

Missiles whisper lullabies to the children of Gaza,  
while brass casings rain like confetti on Tehran’s skyline.  
The headlines do not blink.  
They scream in sans-serif silence.

G7 becomes G8 becomes G∞  
as diplomacy dissolves into golden phones  
and tariffs stitched from the skin of treaties.  
“Because I like them,” he says,  
and the markets purr like warplanes.

Ceasefire is a myth  
told to dying satellites by weeping algorithms.  
Khamenei’s shadow flickers—  
a hologram projected onto the ruins of consensus.

Meanwhile, Minnesota bleeds beneath a red, white, and blue eclipse.  
No Kings, just bullets with ballots for names.  
A Project Runway martyr sewn into the seams of protest.  
Fashion is dead. Long live the spectacle.

Children queue for food beneath tank barrels.  
The line between aid and annihilation  
is drawn in phosphorus.

The Senate debates Medicaid cuts  
while Gaza debates gravity.  
Falling bodies don’t vote.

Somewhere, a pillow defames democracy.  
Somewhere, a phone rings in gold-plated static.  
Somewhere, a man signs a bill with invisible ink  
and calls it peace.

This is not news.  
This is necromancy.

We are all tuned to the same frequency:  
the static hum of empire unraveling.

Do not adjust your set.  
This is the new normal.

This is the poem.

This is the war.
