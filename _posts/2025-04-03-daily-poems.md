**Headline Static Sutures**

Not news. Shrapnel.
Each click a micro-detonation in the optic nerve.

**Tariff-ash** settles spectral on Bouvetøya’s ice.
Power’s phantom limb signs customs forms for penguins.
While the *real* world ignites – nerve endings frayed global,
China’s vow a clenched fist, EU’s countermeasure a drawn scalpel.
Markets **hemorrhage pixels**, red blooms across the ticker tape.
*Reciprocity*: the scalpel turning in your own hand.

(Somewhere, a screen glows: Budapest applauds escape
from the court where justice holds a warrant. History averts its gaze.)

**Fracture Form:**

Floodwaters wear faces.
**HIGH-RISK** screams the algorithm forecasting deluge.
*Once-in-a-lifetime* coughs up muddy water, again.

A child’s heart punctured trackside.
Twin brother catches the silence.
Hold it. Feel its weight against the scroll.

HHS gutted. Files shredded into **data confetti**.
Health’s memory erased. Bird flu research: *pending*.
Visas cancelled like thoughts deemed inconvenient. Futures **nullified**.

Musk’s thumb dances: DOGE / Layoffs / Trump / Mars / Gloat.
The market cap inflates, deflates. **280,000 jobs** vanish
into the *de minimis* loophole of his attention span.

Syntax cracks under pressure:
SCOTUS squints Planned Parenthood sliced thin thin thin
Migrant children **legal aid restored revoked restored** a whiplash of paper mercy.
Booker speaks 25 hours into the void – sound waves seeking purchase.

**Linguistic Alchemy:**

Myanmar’s rubble breathes dust. 3,000+ souls exhale silence.
The General flies to summit, shakes hands over the **seismic grief**.
(Bangkok felt the tremor. Empathy, it seems, has fault lines).

This isn't information.
It's a **cognitive bombardment**.
Designed overwhelm. Designed numbness.

The poem is the counter-charge.
The disruption isn't the chaos you see,
it's the **quantum entanglement** beneath –
the shared vulnerability under the boot of tariffs,
the collective gasp held in the face of the flood,
the human cost tallied in deleted jobs and silenced records.

To see the penguin *and* the trade war,
the dismissed case *and* the weeping twin,
the filibuster *and* the earthquake victim –
simultaneously –
That’s the detonation.
That’s the awakening, surgical and bright.
Feel the cut.

Tariffs bloom like rust on the hull of empire,  
a metallic blossom in the throat of trade—  
penguins taxed, satellites sanctioned,  
the algorithm coughs blood into the feed.

Hungary unhooks from justice,  
while Gaza is divided like a syllable  
in a dying language.  
Musk combusts in the mirror of DOGE,  
his trillion-dollar dream pixelated  
by the scream of layoffs.

The tornado is not weather—  
it is policy.  
It is a metaphor for what we refuse to name:  
a child stabbed at a track meet,  
a president auctioning sovereignty  
on an uninhabited island.

News scrolls like a fever dream—  
Booker filibusters time itself,  
while almonds are liberated  
and beer becomes a luxury.

We are all vapes now—  
flavored, denied,  
exhaled into the void of deregulation.

Somewhere, a Supreme Court weighs  
the soul of Planned Parenthood  
against the weight of silence.

Somewhere, the Switch 2 loads  
a new reality:  
pixelated grief, downloadable dissent.

This is not a poem.  
This is a broadcast from the hive.  
This is the syntax of collapse.  
This is your daily dose of entropy.

Refresh. Reload. Recoil.
