**Feed/Static/Fracture**

(No Author. No Date. Just Now. Always Now.)

World leaders call for calm.
Calm. Called for. After. Strike.
(A pixel bleeds into another pixel: Kashmir / REAL ID / Pope smoke)
The screen, a cold retina-burn.
Each headline a shard, glinting.
*Full Coverage* promises wholeness, delivers
                                                            fragments. More.

Trump’s new fixation: Alcatraz. Metaphor?
Or just another rock to throw
into the churning waters of the feed?
Doll talk. Fewer dolls. Good.
(The algorithm whispers: *engage, enrage, stay numb*)
Missile strike. Missile strike.
                                        Who launched what?
The names blur. Pequeno, Ray, Pequeño IV.
Forbes. Axios. AP. NDTV. CNN.
A chorus of the immediate, a cacophony of the now.

Ukrainian drones. Moscow airports.
                                        (swipe)
Transgender military ban. Upheld.
                                        (swipe)
Gaza malnutrition. Blockade.
                                        (swipe)
The scroll, an endless, self-inflicted wound,
dressed in the ghost-light of blue screens.
Each thumb-flick a tiny shovel,
burying yesterday’s crisis under today’s.

*Operation Sindoor.* What can India expect?
What can *we* expect?
From this relentless ticker-tape of dread,
this firehose of fractured realities?
The Houthi strikes will stop. (Or will they?)
A judge declines. A judge orders.
Justice, a flickering cursor in a document
too vast to comprehend.

They are searching for a backup plan.
(Aren't we all?)
For Senate. For sanity. For a signal
in the noise.
Fentanyl bust. Largest ever.
(A brief, sharp intake of breath before the next wave)
WeightWatchers bankrupt. Met Gala looks.
The juxtaposition, a surgical violence
performed without anaesthetic.

This is not information.
This is a weather system.
A storm of data-shrapnel,
where truth is a casualty,
and empathy, a flickering candle
in a digital hurricane.
The poem, then, not a mirror,
but a hammer.
To crack the screen.
To let the silence in.
To ask:
            what bleeds
                        between the lines?
                                    What screams
                                                unseen?

missiles whisper in the language of ash  
while headlines braid themselves into nooses  
for the mind—  
India, Pakistan,  
a duet of fire across stitched borders,  
Kashmir bleeds in pixels,  
and the world offers calm like a wet match.

REAL ID:  
a barcode for your breath,  
a passport to nowhere,  
as if identity could be laminated.

the conclave smokes white lies,  
choosing popes like algorithms choose ads—  
divine clickbait.

Trump reopens Alcatraz,  
says it’s a metaphor.  
for what?  
for the way we cage ghosts  
and call it justice?

drones kiss Moscow’s skyline,  
a steel-lipped love letter from Ukraine.  
Xi watches.  
Putin watches.  
we all watch.

Gaza starves beneath the weight of strategy.  
children chew silence.  
aid is a rumor with wings clipped.

the Fed holds its breath,  
tariffs dance like knives in a hurricane.  
markets twitch.  
the poor dream of bread.

Smokey Robinson accused—  
Motown melody turns minor key.  
truth leaks through lawsuits.

WeightWatchers files for bankruptcy—  
even the scale can’t bear this century.

a man jailed for a crime he didn’t commit—  
freed by footage, not faith.  
justice is a camera angle.

the Pope is elected.  
the missiles still fall.  
the bears still kill.  
the dolls are still too many.

and somewhere,  
beneath the noise,  
a nurse works a double shift,  
forgotten by every headline.

we are all headlines now—  
scrolling toward oblivion,  
hoping someone reads us before we vanish.
