**February 22, 2025: A Vivisection**

The newsfeed, a flayed carcass, twitching.
Bargains struck in blood, bone, mineral rights.
Ukraine's earth, offered up – a dowry of desperation.
(Zelensky, a tightrope walker above a chasm of Trumps.)

Joint Chiefs, un-chiefed. Loyalty, the new chain of command.
DEI, a four-letter word, erased by judicial fiat,
then blocked, a temporary stay of execution
on the altar of "equality." (The air quotes, visible scars.)

California burns. Again. Forty billion, a whispered prayer
into the ash-choked wind. Will it be enough?
(The question, a rhetorical burn victim.)

Shiri Bibas, returned. *Wrong body*. A headline's brutal poetry.
Grief, a calculus of misidentification.
The mathematics of loss, infinitely indivisible.

Five thousand, four hundred souls, downsized. Pentagon's arithmetic.
Collateral damage in the ledger of efficiency.
(The human cost, a footnote, unread.)

A church administrator, dressed in black, hunts a killer.
Ohio alleyways, the geography of vengeance.
(Justice, a street-level transaction.)

Rushdie's attacker, guilty. The blade's echo in the courtroom.
Words, still weapons, even when silenced.
(The attempted murder of thought, a continuing crime.)

Crypto-abyss. One point five billion, vanished. Digital ghosts.
The illusion of security, a hacked firewall.
(Trust, a currency more volatile than Bitcoin.)

Today. A date stamp on a wound that will not heal.
A vivisection of power, greed, and the fragile human frame.
The scalpel of truth, wielded without anesthesia.
(The scream, silent. The bleeding, everywhere.)

*****  
Steel hands rearrange the board,  
knights toppled, bishops burned,  
a general erased like ink in rain—  
who commands the silence now?  

A body returned, a body mistaken,  
flesh misfiled in the archive of war.  
Grief is a ledger, red-stained,  
balanced by the weight of dust.  

Five thousand ghosts march home,  
pink slips flutter like dying leaves,  
the Pentagon hums a hollow hymn—  
who will man the empty walls?  

Zelensky kneels at the altar of empire,  
offering minerals, offering breath,  
a country pawned for another tomorrow—  
who owns the veins of the earth?  

The judge slams down a gavel of defiance,  
DEI echoes in the hollow halls,  
but bans are shadows that stretch long—  
who decides what history forgets?  

Forty billion dollars for fire’s hunger,  
California smolders, pleads to the sky.  
Ash writes its own constitution—  
who will sign their name in soot?  

A billion stolen in digital whispers,  
a vault cracked by unseen hands.  
Currency dissolves like morning mist—  
who holds wealth when code is dust?  

Rushdie’s blood dried years ago,  
but the blade still gleams in memory.  
A verdict carves its own scripture—  
who wields the pen of justice?  

And in an alley, a woman waits,  
black-clad, shadow-bound,  
tracking death through holy corridors—  
who prays for the hunter’s soul?
