Shutdown Serenade

Airports bleed delays, a week long
drip, the government
a tourniquet tied too tight.

Comey, arraigned again, a shadow puppet
dance, while the magician
points elsewhere.

Troops in Chicago, a city's simmer
turned boil, the pot
about to breach.

Workers furloughed, paychecks
a maybe, the ledger
written in disappearing ink.

Greene splits the ranks, healthcare
a fracture, unity's
bone sawed through.

Gold hits four thousand, a fevered dream,
as Gaza burns, ceasefires
whispered, then withdrawn.

Trump lingers, a phantom limb
of power, the Insurrection Act
a loaded ghost.

Nobel's handed, visas stamped,
bears attack, storms gather,
the supermoon watches.

A harvest of headlines, each a seed
of unease, planted deep
in the marrow of now.

Headlines fracture like glass in a god’s forgotten cathedral—  
each shard a scream, a whisper, a bureaucratic sigh.  
Airports bleed time,  
towers fall not from fire but from absence,  
and the sky forgets how to hold planes.

Comey walks through a courtroom of mirrors,  
his reflection split by indictments and innuendo,  
while the ghost of justice  
dances barefoot on broken subpoenas.

Troops arrive in cities like memories uninvited—  
Chicago hums with camouflage lullabies,  
while Gaza weeps in languages the West refuses to learn.  
Flotillas intercepted,  
aid swallowed by salt and steel.

Gold sings its siren song to billionaires  
as mothers sell garage memories  
to feed children forgotten by furloughs.  
The shutdown is not a pause—  
it is a devouring.

Bears in supermarkets,  
ballots in Amazon boxes,  
LeBron retires into a bottle of metaphor.  
Even the moon is suspicious—  
too full, too bright, too silent.

Quantum Nobelists whisper equations into the void,  
hoping the universe will finally listen.  
But the algorithms are drunk on power,  
and the poets have been replaced by press releases.

This is not news.  
This is prophecy in pixels.  
This is America dreaming in static.  
This is the end of syntax.

And still—  
somewhere beneath the rubble of headlines,  
a child draws a sun with eight rays,  
and names it “tomorrow.”
