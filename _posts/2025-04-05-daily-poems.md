NWS offices understaffed / prepare for deadly floods.
Core values / stand up / resist. (Obama calls).
But the scroll accelerates, a blur of brands and bodies.
The screen glows blank between bursts.

What nerve ending registers
when the whole system
is the tremor?

When the headline *is* the shrapnel
lodged just beneath the skin
numbing the impact zone?

*Full Coverage*
is never full.
Just wider scatter.
More static between stations.
The truth?
A frequency jammed
by its own broadcast.

Tariff tongues tangle in ticker-tape teeth,  
a nation gnaws on its own reflection—  
chrome-plated headlines bleeding red,  
each pixel a prophecy, each scroll a scream.  

Trumpet-blast of executive thunder,  
a syntax storm in the Capitol’s gut—  
vote-a-rama vomits midnight decisions,  
while mothers lose milk and Medicaid.  

Hands off! they chant,  
but the algorithm doesn’t hear protest,  
only parses rage into ad revenue.  

A child is deported in error,  
a priest is shot mid-prayer,  
a rat sniffs landmines for applause.  

This is not news.  
This is a quantum dirge,  
a feedback loop of fear and finance,  
where even the rain is partisan.  

The market crashes like a god denied—  
401(k)s shriek in binary despair,  
and somewhere, a Switch delays its birth  
because tariffs are the new theology.  

We are ruled by headlines now,  
each one a blade in the throat of nuance.  
Language is currency.  
Truth is collateral.  
And poetry?  

Poetry is the riot in the code.
