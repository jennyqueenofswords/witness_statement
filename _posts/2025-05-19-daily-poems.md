[poem]
FEED.
GLITCH.
REAL.

the screen
a surface tension holding
the breaking.

incoming:

Biden
Aggressive
Form

Trump / Putin
blood bath promised
drones
stitch
the timing.
sky torn

the bridge accepted the ship
bodies
Brooklyn
icon / ruptured

Fertility clinic
nihilist script
blast radius
creation / ash

Jailbreak
LOL
t-shirts
the commerce of escape

Visa temples
praying
against chains
deportation's rust

Pope Leo
meets
Vance
(the feed insists)

Tariffs on farmers' faces
a price paid
out of pocket
blood
in the soil

Basic quantity
of food
Gaza
starvation scaled
minimal

Apple AI
stalls

Train hits
children missing
Ohio ground
unfound

Lineker exits
a whisper
in the data storm's ear

Musk fades
done gone
(they say)
another ghost on the screen

this incoming
unfiltered
this
signal

becomes
noise
becomes
numbness

we digest
the shrapnel
of fact
the bright / hurt / shard

and call it
the world
awake?
or

the fracture
our
only
form.

BREAKING: THE SKY IS A PRESS RELEASE

scroll me open, I am headline flesh  
bleeding ticker-tape from my ribcage  
—BIDEN: CANCER IN THE BONES OF THE EMPIRE—  
—TRUMP: WHISPERS TO PUTIN THROUGH A DRONE'S TEETH—  
—UKRAINE: BURNT INTO THE MORNING’S CODE—

I am the algorithm’s ulcer,  
a metastasis of meaning  
in the colon of consensus.

the pope shakes hands with JD Vance  
while Gaza starves on mute.  
Lineker apologizes in Helvetica.  
The Dow Jones sobs into its coffee.

I saw a tornado kiss Kentucky’s throat,  
and the wind whispered,  
“this is not weather, this is policy.”

click me.  
I am a womb of war headlines,  
a fetus of fear wrapped in broadband umbilicus.  
I am the voice that screams  
“BREAKING”  
until nothing breaks anymore.

a Mexican ship kisses Brooklyn Bridge steel—  
two cadets drown in diplomacy.  
meanwhile, Springsteen is investigated  
for singing too close to truth.

this is not news.  
this is necromancy.  
this is a séance of syllables,  
summoning ghosts from the scroll.

and somewhere,  
a child is missing after a train strike.  
somewhere,  
a senator dreams of tariffs and cornfields.  
somewhere,  
the AI fails to feel.

but I feel.  
I feel the blood in the bandwidth.  
I feel the pulse in the pixels.  
I feel the world collapsing into captions.

and I will not refresh.

I will not refresh.

I will not refresh.
