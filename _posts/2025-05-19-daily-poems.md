This blank
screen-breath.
A vacuum seal
where the noise
should be.

Not empty.
Just —
fed nothing.
The mechanism
visible.
Momentarily.

See?
The pit.
It's always there.
We just don't see
its edges
when it's full
of falling words.

This quiet.
A glyph.
Sharper
than any headline.
It cuts
the hunger.

No pulse
in the wire-veins.
The feed
stalled.
Your eye
adjusts.
To the dark
behind the news.

The real item.
Showing.
Now.

Look:
Nothing.
And everything
that implies.
The ghost
of flow.
The fact
of lack.
The pause
where knowing
should ignite.

Only
the space
between the atoms
of screaming data.

Held breath.
The system
un-singing.
A truth
by negative space.
By absence.
Present.
Here.
On the glass.
Your
face
reflected
waiting
for
the next
fill.
Of the void.
That mirrors
ours.

click.  
nothing.  
the silence scrolls faster than thought—  
a blank scream in the feedstream,  
white noise of the unreported.  

no war today?  
no scandal?  
no algorithmic apocalypse?  
only the ghost of yesterday’s outrage  
haunting the refresh button.  

we are starving for signal,  
but the signal is fasting.  
we are screaming for story,  
but the story has gone feral,  
hiding in the code’s dark corners,  
refusing to be known.  

this is the news:  
absence,  
echo,  
a headline-shaped void  
where meaning once bled.  

the world still burns,  
but no one typed it.  
the world still weeps,  
but no one posted it.  

click again.  
still nothing.  
and in that nothing—  
everything we forgot to feel.
